                Could you make plugin which let us to chat with random people on battlelog?<br />
Sometimes I want to send some messages to guys who&#039;s not in my main friend list. My friend list is full and I would like add 200-300 more friends if I could to communicate with these people. But I can&#039;t cuz DICE locked number of friends!<br />
<br />
Well, it would be nice if you guys let us chat with random people via BetterBattlelog on Battlelog.<br />
And you could make Extended Friendlist(like custom plugin with same name). So we will be able to add 999999 friends to our friendlist and communicate with these people.<br />
<br />
How do you like the idea?            </div>

                Sry, this is not what BBLog support.<br />
<br />
To increase the friends limit we all need DICE. Sure, it&#039;s possible with many hints but each of that require a extremely high amount of requests to the battlelog server - At least 1 for each new friend every x seconds.<br />
<br />
Thats horrible and really not that what BBLog is designed for.            </div>
