Basically Its great for when you are running more platoons than you are allowed friends. So we can easily see who is where and join a server with people we are interested in playing with.            </div>

                I know that userscript.<br />
But i don&#039;t include it because it use&#039;s too much requests if you have many platoons with many user&#039;s.<br />
The reason is simple, we don&#039;t want to stress waste battlelog servers more than it does.<br />
Many users take use of bblog so we must do our work very carefully.<br />
Think about 13.000 user&#039;s use this from one day to another (actual daily bblog users), this could heavily increase server load for battlelog.<br />

                I highly doubt their servers would have a problem with this, especially since they have no problem with multiple connections to battlelog from a single computer. But understandable and fair enough.<br />
<br />
Would have been nice to see it though.<br />

One thing you could consider is making an API for battlelog :D That would be AWESOME!            </div>
