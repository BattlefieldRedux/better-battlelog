                Hello,<br />
I activate some add on options together with &#039;scoreboard+&#039; add on in bblog options gallery in Chrome for BF3.<br />
Other add ons started working after a F5 refresh but scoreboard+ didn&#039;t work.<br />
I closed and opened back chrome instead of F5 refresh, that didn&#039;t help.<br />
Any ideas? please help...<br />
Thanx in advance.            </div>

                afaik battlelog for the bf3 version got updated and the needed information for this plugin are no longer available.<br />
With other words, this plugin is not and will never again work.            </div>

                Thank you MrFixit for your quick reply...<br />
this was a very useful feature of bblog and the original battlelog. It was a real time saver to see whats going on in game, scores, etc. without joining the server.<br />
May be you or another plugin developer can rewrite the plugin and make it work again ? <br />
IMHO, BF3 will be played for long as it is different and some ways better than BF4 and BF1.<br />
Thanx again...            </div>

                I wanted to say that it&#039;s no longer possible to do this.<br />
They (creators of battlelog) changed things and the information you need for this plugin is not available and so we can&#039;t so anything there            </div>

                ok, I looked at it again.<br />
It&#039;s still working, BUT there are two things you have to check.<br />
<br />
1) Because Google Chrome disabled NPAPI-Plugins you need to use a different browser then Google Chrome, I tested it with Firefox.<br />
2) In your profile settings you need to uncheck the box &quot;Use plugin-free game launching&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also check whether you have the Battlelog Web Plugins installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
After that do a reload of the page and the plugin should work again :)<br />
<br />
Proof:<br />
<div class="post-image-prepared inline"></div><br />
<br />
EDIT: Firefox also dropped the NPAPI support, the Internet Explorer is still working with this though            </div>
