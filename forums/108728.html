                Hi!<br />
<br />
Just want to open a topic where we all can list things that do not work as expected.<br />
<br />
This thread should just list things that are buggy and this thread should no be used to discuss problems. Only a list of facts. Simple and handy. The battlelog forums is full of flamers that doesn&#039;t really help.<br />
<br />
I begin<br />
<br />
* Tower Collapse - All is stuck in the air when the tower collapse<br />
* Random Frame Drops, doesn&#039;t matter which hardware on PC<br />
* Delayed Stats in Battlelog<br />
* Settings sometimes not loaded/saved properly<br />
* Report Screen Ingame - Overlay of some elements<br />
* Report Screen - Weird glitches on summarize points for ribbons, medals, etc...<br />
* Flares of Heli sometimes doesn&#039;t help<br />
* Support Ammo - Unexpected behaviour, doesn&#039;t reload ammo for me most of the time - Maybe i use the wrong ammo pack<br />
* Support Ammo - Sometimes on drop ammo it fly miles away<br />
* Glitches when heli explode in air - Elements stuck in air<br />
* Interface looks &quot;muddy&quot;, no clear edges, looks like upscaling<br />
* Hit detection of explosives sometimes does not work properly - Rocket on a tank, no explosion is visible, for example<br />
* Battlelog doesn&#039;t work when you have the language in url, exampl /de/ or /fr/ or something like that<br />
* Deploy window stuck sometimes - Nothing clickable - Goto Menu and Back solve it            </div>

                Support ammo - are you using the big pack? The small one only replenishes the ammo of the person that walks over it.            </div>

Ok, that could be my fail. Will take a closer look into the specs.            </div>

                When I start the game, first time I visit the deploy screen, I can not click on any deploy point, and in the background, I can see the flag labels moving, like from the first person view from some other already deployed player. Escaping into menu and back fixes it.<br />

No problems here with latest Chrome version.<br />

And who was expecting the Beta would be perfect? I mean, it&#039;s not just called a Beta for some extra marketing. :-)            </div>
