                Hello,<br />
<br />
i have a new idea for a plugin:<br />
<br />
A new list where you can add URLs of any player to have a new advanced friendslist, where you can add every player without any limit. I think it dont have to be in the commcenter, a new list beside would be enough. <br />
It would be fine to see there online status, and to have a &quot;join server&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Regards Fenriswolf<br />

Yes, cause the possibility is given yet, you can bookmark any other profile and take a look if he or she is online, playing or so on. The Status of each player is public in battlelog.            </div>
