                Hello,<br />
<br />
I released a plugin on Github which allows you to set a custom teamspeak server instead of the default one.<br />
<br />
Release is here:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">https://github.com/ColdIce1/Better-Battlelog-Custom-Teamspeak/tree/master</div><br />
<br />
You can use this link in BBLog to get the plugin:<br />

                Hello,<br />
<br />
This plugin is a nice idea, but I can&#039;t find how to set the Teamspeak server IP, login password ?<br />
The only one thing I have found is to set an ID???            </div>

Check on the github link, there is an explanation on what you need to do<br />
<br />
This is a great plugin, Thanks Man!<br />
Would be nice if we had a login to server button, just like the one present on tsviewer.com :)            </div>

                I&#039;ve installed this and it does not work. At least not with the new BBlog 4.9.0 version. I added the ID for my TS and refreshed the page as required and all does is open the BBlog TS. Useless! I&#039;ve even checked the coding and when you attempt to view the code from the plugins button, there are errors and you can&#039;t save it. I&#039;d check your coding and try again because this does not/no longer works.            </div>

Deaktivate &quot;BBLog Teamspeak&quot; and than refresh :D            </div>
