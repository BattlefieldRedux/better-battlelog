                Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I would like to request a plugin that increase the size of the Game Activity window. I like to look at recent activities from friends or search for mine to share them (when I got medals, service starts, unlocks, assignments and stuff, like it was before the update) and the actual size bugs me, it&#039;s too small in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I bet it&#039;s pretty easy to create it but unfortunately I don&#039;t have the resources to do it. There is a lot of space on the right site, so I thought about something like this: <div class="inline post-url">http://localhostr.com/file/wqkjnHwawLwM/Battlefield-3-2012-09-15-09-33-06.png</div> Maybe a few people like my idea and one of you write one. That would be pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
Greetings and thanks in advance (whatever the answer is :-P)            </div>
