                Ok, this has been bothering me since it happened and now I even took the time to register on this forum to complain about it ;)<br />
<br />
No big deal really, but since i work on websites a lot the placement of the options buton for BBlog is just bugging me. That spot in a menu is where 99% of website users expect a menu item that takes them to the home page, not some settings of a plugin. To me that&#039;s just bad UI design. I&#039;d suggest you place it after &#039;Forums&#039; where it belongs if you relly feel it deservers a spot in the sites main navigation. There is no marketing reason I can think of for you to justify the hijacking of the Home button location.<br />
<br />
That being said, thanks for this absolutely great browser plugin! :D            </div>

                You should visit the &quot;BBlog Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;BBLog Options Icon at the right of page instead left&quot;<br />
Nothing more to say :-)            </div>
