                Hi,<br />
<br />
me idea is a &quot;stalk button&quot;. I&#039;m often looking for players with exclusive dogtags, like the &quot;5 times Mortar Medal&quot;, to knife them. Today I&#039;m allways typin the player&#039;s name in the search box to check if the player is online and playin, because nearly nobody is accepting my freinds request. It would be a massive improvement, if i had a list, where i can directly see the online status (like the friends list). <br />
<br />
I&#039;m thinking of a button like the &quot;Radar Button&quot;, for example &quot;Stalk Button&quot;. By clickin these button the player will be added to a stalk list. By clickin on the stalk list, i can see all my added players with their online status and if available a server link where i can join.    <br />
<br />

                BBLog will never add a feature like this. We don&#039;t support dogtag hunters because it&#039;s horrible when somebody can&#039;t play without being stalked all day long (Like the DICE Employees).<br />
You can ask for it in the plugin section.            </div>
