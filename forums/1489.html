My BBLog Addon Version is: 1.02<br />
<br />
After we installed BBlog, we have noticed some weird issues with creating party and joining to same party with friends, sometimes its just buggy and hard. Maybe it says you are already in a party, or only a party leader can invite (even though you are the leader) etc. Also inviting friends to a server sometimes just doesn&#039;t show up to the friend you are inviting. Can these problems be related to the BBlog extension?            </div>

                No, BBLog do not affect any parts that you described.<br />
Mostly everybody have huge problems with party and feature depending on this.<br />
Also some of my friends (which not installed bblog because they use IE) have the same problems as you describe.<br />
So, i could definetly say - This bugs not from BBLog.<br />
