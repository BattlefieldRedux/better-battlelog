                This plugin is supposed to get the ping of your friends&#039; server and give you the tooltip of it and a quick color indicator to give you an idea at a glance. As far as I know the tooptip is working; every server is giving me a ping of &quot;-ms&quot; so I have no way of really knowing if it is giving me the right ping or just the ping of one of the servers.<br />
Right now it will fetch the ping on domchange, but when and if the plugin gets fully working, I&#039;ll change it to update on an interval and to stop when a game is playing to reduce the footprint. It is just for quick testing purposes right now.<br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions or concerns let me know.<br />
