                That is true. BBLog is designed to (not) do this because https is a secure thing.<br />
BBLog doesn&#039;t have https certificates because it costs money (120 &euro; per year).<br />
And BBLog&#039;s first directive is: Be secure, be serious.<br />
BBLog Addon requires some connections to BBLog servers (Addon checks, news, cloud, etc...) and that connection is not secure because of the lack of a ssl certificate.<br />
So therefore we don&#039;t add support for https. Technically it is not a problem but it&#039;s not secure to connect from https  http.<br />
And a self signed certificate is also a no-go.            </div>

i just tought you could leave bblogs conncetions unsecure and just make it possible to connect to battefields servers securly but a guess you dont like the idea            </div>

                as he said:<br />
<blockquote>Technically it is not a problem but it&#039;s not secure to connect from https  http.</blockquote><br />
<br />
that means, a user HAVE a SECURED Connection if he have https.<br />
So, if he use BBLog unsecured he DON&#039;T have a 100% secured connection during using https.<br />
<br />
We DONT WANT that the users have misstakes like this.            </div>

                Yep. Secure to unsecure or unsecure to secure connection as a no-go for us (and should also be a no-go for all others).            </div>

                Seems like GoDaddy.com is giving away 1 year certifications FREE of charge for open source projects.<br />
Last time I checked BBLog is open source so I guess you could grab a certificate if you feel like it brain :P<br />
<div class="inline post-url">https://www.godaddy.com/ssl/ssl-open-source.aspx</div><br />
<br />
If nothing else it could be nice to try it for 1 year, when it&#039;s free and all.            </div>

                godaddy gave me a free SSL for a year when i bought the hosting for my charity.  it wasn&#039;t part of the plan or anything...  i just asked them if they would do it, and they did.            </div>

                The problem is, i also have a 1 year free SSL certificate from my hoster BUT after this year it costs much money.<br />
If a integrate SSL now and than remove it in 1 year again we have 2 problems:<br />
<br />
1. Code that need to be reworked again<br />
2. Many pissed off people.            </div>

                Oh, I understand.<br />
<br />
I guess you can use one of the free (free for ever) certification services out there that no browser recognizes and for that matter puts up a WARNING every time you try to load the page. LoL, joke...            </div>
