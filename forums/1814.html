                Hey once again!<br />
<br />
Being able to set Favourite and Blacklist (Using Blacklist due to my other post (Otherwise assume Radar)) denotes how you feel about the server already. With this idea I think it will make the most out of both of the functions.<br />
<br />
1) After settings your filters and pressing Search, it will search for all servers as normal - but then it will sort the &#039;Favourite&#039; servers to the top of the list regardless of how the table is sorted. The other servers will be displayed normally, it will just move the favourite&#039;s to the top.<br />
This will show you that there is a Favourite servers that meets your parameters and is likely to be a preferred choice because you marked it so.<br />
<br />
2) You could extend this further, and move the Blacklisted servers out of the top - but its not necessary.            </div>

Thanks for your feedback,<br />
The 2nd was just an extra I thought of as I was typing, I wasn&#039;t overly hyped about it myself.<br />

                There be too much technical problems with this features for us.<br />
Only DICE can do any kind of this sort in a consistent way on the server side.<br />
We can only search in the listed servers and everybody knows that battlelog only list a small bunch off all found servers in the list per default.<br />
Also it makes not much since to sort it on top, we already mark favorite servers in the list.<br />

                Why changing color, its already blue.<br />
Favorites blue with star icon.<br />
Blacklisted have also a icon, the red radar.<br />
I&#039;m not here to change colors because somebody don&#039;t like it.            </div>

                Again for you brain:<br />
i don&#039;t tell you my ideas because I don&#039;t like it.<br />
i tell you my ideas because I THINK, it could be BETTER.<br />
<br />
i told you more than once so please stop with your argumentation &quot;because somebody (you mean me, i know) don&#039;t like it&quot;. i have to do a lot with graphics and visualisations in my profession so don&#039;t think, i would just told you this point, because my stomach thinks it would be better.<br />
<br />
<br />
again: i think it would be more highlighted and would be better visible, if you would choose a darker blue, not this light one, or a yellow. not everybody have perfect color settings like you and without the right prespective to the screen it mostly unvisible.<br />
<br />
currently it looks like a really light grey on a white board, you see the differnce just with a lot of hassle. so if you dont want to change it, than say that, but dont say because &quot;somebody&quot; dont like it.<br />
<br />
