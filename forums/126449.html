                Hello people,<br />
<br />
I have been playing bf4 for quite some time and joined alot of servers. If I liked the server, I would have added it to my favorites. The problem now is, there areso much servers in my favorite, that it realy doesnt make a diffirence with the server browser. But I want to be able to for example find the filming server I record cinematics. And it would be alot easier if I could make maps in my favorites. It&#039;d be awesome if someone could do this, since all I know about coding is that its hard. So please, somebody be awesome and make this :D.<br />
<br />
Sorry for bad english,<br />

No, I mean that you can make maps in your favorites tab, so you can easily &quot;sort&quot; the servers. Just like in this forum, where as example the plugins are in a different map than the themes. Get it?            </div>

The Server Browser and Favourites have a map sort function:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">Unbenannt.png</div><br />
Or are we talking about a different function?            </div>

                Maybe you need Categories on Favorite Servers? So you can put each reserver on a category?            </div>

basically I want to be able to place my favorites inside maps. let me make an example here.<br />
<br />
this the favorites tab.<br />
<br />
<br />
(filming servers)<br />
(operation locker servers)<br />
(punkbuster free servers)<br />
(misc servers)<br />
(all maps servers)<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
what im trying to say, is that I simply want maps so I can sort out my favorites and keep the tab clean. not letting the browser sord it in followup order, but letting me place everything in seperate maps. I hope you get what im going to :)            </div>

Not sure if you (or someone else) still want this plugin. But I&#039;m developing it right now :)<br />
I think I can upload it during the next days. 75% should be finished at this moment :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: It&#039;s nearly finished. 95% is done. Just some optimizations and bug testing needed.<br />
I will release it today or tomorrow. We&#039;ll see.<br />
<br />
EDIT2: Status: 99.9% finished ;)<br />
Today (wednesday) I&#039;ll release it. Just some name changes needed.<br />
<br />
