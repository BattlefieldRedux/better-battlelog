                Any way to get a plug in that would link to a players PBBans account for server admins to check on people?? Would cut down on a few steps and streamline checking possible hackers            </div>

                I don&#039;t think that would be possible.<br />
To do a search on PBBans you have to enter a Captcha. Also the URL for a player&#039;s ban details does not have their name in it.<br />
If you could get the GUID that you might have a chance but when I try it no matter what I do it keeps saying the Captcha has expired.<br />
<br />
You could do this with Metabans.com however.<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://metabans.com/search/</div>[player name]<br />
But even that&#039;s not perfect            </div>

                For GGC maybe works, but you need an API key.            </div>
