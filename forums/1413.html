                There were a lot of mistakes so I wanted to improve it for you:<br />
And thank you for making bblog.<br />

The plot is generated by simulating weapon bursts with data from the left side. The plot should only be used as an optical gimmick to display to you the accuracy data more visually. Single shot is not represented because the accuracy varies for every player (time between each shot). For single shot weapons this is a fictive simulation just for clarification. Plots on symthic.com differ from the bblog plots, but every plot shows the same usable information - How much the weapon spreads.            </div>
