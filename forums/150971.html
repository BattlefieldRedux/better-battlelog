                Is it possible to make a plugin that can hide a lot of weapons on the stats page, so it only shows the weapons I want to check out? The reason for this is that I try to get 500 kills with each weapon/vehicle/equipment and I have to scroll a lot to get to the weapon I want to check.<br />
<br />
I have the plugin that hides the missions I have completed and the one that hides the assignments I have done. So maybe it&#039;s possible?<br />

                You can just use the BBLog weapon filter, enter the weapons you just want to display, separated with a comma<br />
