                Yo!<br />
<br />
I saw a nice way to improve the assignments page for the assignment hungry. This plugin puts up searchable (ctrl+f) headers for assignments, and also puts up 4 upcoming assignments so you have a bit easier time to figure out what you want to do next. Here&#039;s a screenie:<br />
<br />

<br />
Please note that this is still in the beta, and has a positioning bug in the scrolling detail thing - but nothing serious.<br />
<br />
Do you guys know a good way to fetch an image of the upcoming unlock, so I wouldnt have to display a copy of the assignment image? It would be better to see an image of that SCAR-L that I&#039;m about to unlock than that messy assignment image...<br />
<br />
You can have your way with my code in <div class="inline post-url">https://github.com/NikkiLoveGod/assignmentinfo</div> <br />
<br />
Or you can simply take this simple, yet powerful plugin straight from the oven to your gluttony bellys in here - <div class="inline post-url">https://raw.github.com/NikkiLoveGod/assignmentinfo/master/assignmentinfo.js</div><br />
<br />
BTW,  Oh, and it doesn&#039;t work for custom assignments done by BBlog.<br />

                Very good idea !<br />
<br />
- All texts are in english..it doesn&#039;t work in french (and other languages?!)<br />
- Upcoming Unlocks doesn&#039;t work for me, it shows 50% done (0/10 revives) for best friends forever but it&#039;s already 100% done for me<br />
- I don&#039;t like the assignment title on the image, it hides the weapon drawing when you looking for an assignment..instead of the showing the title...maybe it will be more efficient/user friendly to put a search text area (as for weapons/vehicles areas)            </div>

Yes, all texts are  in english. The data comes through BF3stats.com and I dont know if (or how) they support different languages and translatons. Translation is usually quite complicated to do, so I dont think I will be investing a lot of time for it.<br />
<br />
Can you give me your battlelog name, so i can take a look why it shows it incorrectly?<br />
<br />
Visuals are always a matter of opinion and peronally I think displaying a header with the name is better usability. Atleast in my usecase. Putting up a searchfield is not a bad idea, but I think its again a bit too demanding to build it vs. Its benefits. I&#039;ll see if I can move the headers from overlapping the images and still make it look good.            </div>

I took a look, if this is your battlelog (http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/soldier/Amkhatar/assignments/218648765/ps3/) It&#039;s a bug where this always get&#039;s the PC data, so untill I update the plugin, it doesn&#039;t know to fetch ps3 data when appropriate. Thanks for pointing this out!            </div>

<br />
But all texts are already translated in the Battlelog, is it not possible to fetch all texts from battlelog according to the selected language ?<br />
Otherwise the plugin become mostly useless for those haven&#039;t a battlelog in english !            </div>

He&#039;s getting the text from a third-party, and they _do not_ provide text in anything other than English. It&#039;s not as easy as just grabbing the text from the page (Battlelog), because there is no text - it&#039;s images.<br />
<br />
OP - you could create a translations file and have people help translate.            </div>
