                Hey, I just installed BBlog and I figured out how to add players to my radar. I even selected a random server, added a random guy from it to my radar and refreshed the page... I don&#039;t get it, how can I find my radar list and see where they are playing right now? It&#039;s like the only reason I would use BBlog for, and if that is not possible then I have no use of it.            </div>

                BBLog does not support any stalking thingy. Therefore you will NOT see the current status for the players in your radar list.            </div>
