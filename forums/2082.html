                With the new battlelog update, we have now access to 16 latest battle report...Maybe the presentation can be improved ?<br />
<br />
thumbnails, dates and green or grey colors for wins or losses and we keep hover informations...<br />

                The reason why they changed the reports to be represented by a dot until a roll-over is to save space. If you change it back, wouldn&#039;t that defeat the purpose. :/ I do like the making the loses grey though.            </div>

                Yeah , I understand but why save space ?<br />
No need to save space for non-premium and premium who don&#039;t save battle reports..<br />
<br />
I think this dot design is less user-friendly as my proposal but this improvement could be optional like others feature in BBlog            </div>

                This isn&#039;t really an &quot;improvements&quot;, it&#039;s more a change with the same usage.<br />
You see already the wins, the loses, map and the dates but in a other way than before.<br />
It makes not mut sense to change it back because this layout isn&#039;t more bad than the old before.<br />
Maybe someone in the plugin section will help you, moved.            </div>
