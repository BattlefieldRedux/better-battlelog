                Hi!<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b"><div class="tag tag-u">Breaking Change: BBLog will not longer support the Image Upload.</div></div> <br />
<br />
After the last battlelog update our own image upload is broken (15. June 2013). They have changed something in the background and on the editor page.<br />
<br />
One thing that i want to point out: DICE definetely don&#039;t want self made real pictures for platoons. They have talked with us in the past about this. We, BBLog, had raised against this in the talk with DICE and until the last update we supported our own hosted image upload. But for now it&#039;s time to shut it off. <br />
<br />
This feature always required a lot of our server capacity and BBLog always grow and grow. So, we shut it down for several reasons. <br />
At really first it is because of DICE - We don&#039;t want that BBLog will get in struggle in the future with DICE/EA because of that feature. DICE never really had forbidden us that feature but they not really happy about that.<br />
At second because of server capacity - Especially when BF4 is coming out we expect a big user increase. This shut down made sure that all is working fine also when a lot more user will come to BBLog.<br />
<br />
So, some bad news for all of you out there: BBLog will not longer support the Image Upload. <br />
<br />
But YOU, the community can do something against it.<br />
Create a very active, but friendly, discussion on battlelog, in every language, with all your power to made clear that the community really want a image upload in battlelog for platoons.<br />
DICE will definitely think about it when the community really want it.<br />

                That&#039;s amazing. We don&#039;t need the image upload anyway, the battlelog emblem editor is the best, not even Photoshop can beat it.<br />

Are you sure? I don&#039;t think so. Are they even in charge for battlelog? I thought ESN (acquired by (of course) EA) is responsible for battlelog.            </div>

                History<br />
<br />
From Oct 2011 to Sept 2012 it was possible to upload images (with a trick) directly in battlelog, so the images was visible for all people - All those images are still visible for all people.<br />
From Sept 2012 to June 2013 it was only possible by and for BBLog users. All those images now not visible anymore.<br />
<br />
When you see now real images on a platoon they uploaded it in the first period and never changed it.            </div>

                I actually don&#039;t understand the lock. People are requesting a feature and the answer is a lock? That can&#039;t be right. That&#039;s not how you treat your customers. But well, it&#039;s EA, I am not sure what I was expecting.<br />
<br />
I do really want the platoon image upload back or at least (and it would perfectly fine for me) a possibility to use a Gravatar for your platoon. The emblem editor is not just bad, it&#039;s really bad. If I just think about all these community and clan logos, there is no way to recreate them with the Battlelog editor... And a logo is in my opinion a (pretty) important way to represent you and your community or clan.            </div>

I like the lock reason. Apparently customer demands are irrelevant and not important.<br />

I guess the Battlelog forum is the wrong place to ask for Battlelog features.            </div>
