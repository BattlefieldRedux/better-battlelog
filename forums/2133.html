                As it is now it highlights favorite servers and EA is highlighting (at least in the Favorites) when someone on your friends list is in your favorites.<br />
Is it possible to highlight your friends when you look at the server&#039;s page?<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://imgur.com/09voX</div>            </div>
        </div>
                <div class="forums-post-single ">

                Possible yes, but make it sense?<br />
You already see in your friendlist where your friends are playing.            </div>

                As I show in the example, you can see what side they are on and you can choose which side to join on to if possible.<br />
Or maybe you just want to turn the Live Feed on and watch to see what happens if you&#039;re not in the mood to play or waiting until the round is over. You can watch them more easily to how well they are doing.            </div>

looking that way, would be a nice idea for some clans.            </div>
