                Hey guys! Good job so far - I was told to write my ideas up here after emailing Roland directly. I didn&#039;t realize this existed! I have a few ideas I will be posting here, I will do them separately so you can easily view and edit them.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u">This is regarding the &quot;Radar&quot; feature.</div><br />
1) I am not sure &quot;Radar&quot; is a good name for this, it doesn&#039;t have an instant relate-able feel to it. Instead you should call it &quot;Blacklist&quot; (Blacklisted Player, Blacklisted Server). It is a very easy word to instantly understand what this feature is for and gives it a clear definition.<br />
I have seen quite a few posts about people that aren&#039;t sure what the Radar feature is used for. If it was called Blacklist, that wouldn&#039;t be an issue.<br />
<br />
2) When you Blacklist a player or a server, allow users to add a message that will be easily displayed when you try to join a server with a blacklist mark on it (or with a player in that server). It would be nice to know why you blacklisted it/them in the first place.<br />
Possibly just make it a hover over (If you hover over the &quot;Blacklisted&quot; mark it will display the message you have written - so it doesn&#039;t tale up unnecessary space.            </div>

                Good Idea!<br />
i would support the Names &quot;Server Blacklist&quot;, &quot;Player Blacklist&quot; and &quot;Forum Blacklist&quot;<br />
<br />
on this point: please replace the &quot;reset&quot; button to the last place, not to the first, and use for them a more &quot;unvisible&quot; color, it would be the best if it would be only a normal link like before change.            </div>

Thanks for the feedback again!<br />
Nice simple names with instant understanding. Makes sense for me at least!<br />

                I like this idea as well :) Hope brain will implement/change this in BBLog.<br />
It does sound better with the names that ORFK suggested so if brain does implement this I hope he uses those instead.            </div>

<br />
Its the same as I said above.<br />
A &#039;Blacklisted Server&#039; gets put on the &#039;Server Blacklist&#039;<br />
<br />
If you are looking at a server though, just a simple &#039;Blacklisted&#039; or &#039;Blacklisted *object*&#039; would be enough.<br />
<br />
Right Click -&gt; <div class="tag tag-b">Add to Server Blacklist</div><br />
When Looking at a blacklisted server -&gt; <div class="tag tag-b">Warning!: Server is Blacklisted!</div><br />
<br />
You get the point :P            </div>

                I don&#039;t will change the &quot;radar&quot; to &quot;blacklist&quot; - It&#039;s just a design note and personally opinion.<br />
<br />
About adding a message when adding to list, impossible with current storage structure.<br />
It needs a complete rewrite of all radar features when i add this, definitely no way :-)<br />

Reset button will be moved down but will be a button.            </div>

<br />
Seeing as I see quite a few posts on here with people that don&#039;t know what Radar is, seems like its not just my personal opinion. People don&#039;t know what Radar means without reading on your website about it and I bet not many people can be assed to do that.<br />
It feels like with the current name, the Radar will be pretty much unused my many.<br />
<br />
Its clear that some people agree, just reading the comments above. It just makes sense.            </div>

                On the other hand, there 100% exist people that don&#039;t know what a blacklist/whitelist is.<br />
So therefore a change make some people happy but confuses other people.<br />
One problem which comes along with a name change, all description, videos, screenshots, external news depends on the &quot;radar&quot;. <br />
If any people read this and don&#039;t find it in BBLog they also will be confused.<br />
It makes more problems than good things the blacklist change.            </div>
