                Hi folks.<br />
<br />
Loving this game. I got it because I didn&#039;t want anything else with my PS4 and now I&#039;m hooked. Pretty new to online FPS in general and only want to get better. I tried COD about a year ago and was board within 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if this is the right place but I&#039;m really looking for people to play with in squads. I hate &quot;lone wolfing.&quot;<br />
<br />
PSN: Dclark20<br />
Time Zone: Central<br />
Play Time: Usually 630:p - 11:30p give or take.<br />
<br />
I enjoy all game modes but some of them are a bit intimidating if you don&#039;t have a squad I think. I&#039;ve mostly stuck to TDM so that I can better learn the ways around the game and just how to shoot better. Looking for people to play the objectives with.<br />
