                Hi all!<br />
<br />
BF Hardline will come soon and BBLog will also integrate the BBLog Emblem Gallery in that game.<br />
<br />
But, as it is now, the gallery isn&#039;t perfect.<br />
We have tons of emblems in it but most of this are crap and nobody uses it.<br />
<br />
So my idea is to remove unused emblems periodically.<br />
<br />
I think about something like: If an emblem isn&#039;t used within 1 month anymore, it should be automatically deleted - Doesn&#039;t matter if it have been used before or not.<br />
<br />
What do you think about that idea?            </div>

                Good idea, but I suggest a little change. Why not make instead of 1 soldier that used the logo for the month, two or three users? For example, to its emblem will not removed, the emblem can use by author himself or his friends.            </div>

                Yes, that&#039;s what i want to find out here, what is better.<br />
<br />
But one note that maybe is required to find a good idea:<br />
The cache is flushed after 3 days - So one soldier can currently come back after 3 days and use the emblem again and it will be counted again. This behaviour cannot be changed because of performance issues.<br />
<br />
So maybe a higher limit will not make sense since the same user can make multiple counts.            </div>
