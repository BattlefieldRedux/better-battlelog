                Hi. am im useless with code and things related thus I do not know how to create my own theme. Can you please make A tutorial kinda thing? that would really help. I really have a good theme in mind but I have no Idea how to implement. For any of you&#039;se wander what tis, it is the dark them e(sorry to whomever made it, im not good with names) with a bit of blue but also a bit of red. Given these colours are in the right place, it would look pretty good. Anywayz, is it possible for any of you&#039;se to make a tutorial on how to code your own themes w/ screenshots to show what you are doing? thanks. Roza. P.s. Brain you are doing a great job with this app. You honestly should get paid for this app. It is brilliant.            </div>

                You need to know much about HTML and CSS and the Know-How to Reverse-Engineer a website to find out where, which and why things are be so.<br />
So, nobody can write a &quot;simple&quot; tutorial about it. And detailed stuff is much enough out there.<br />
Google: &quot;html tutorial&quot;, &quot;css tutorial&quot;, &quot;firebug tutorial&quot;            </div>

                Is it possible for you to provide the css coding of the original battlelog so we can just tweak it?            </div>

                It makes no sense to provide this when you don&#039;t understand it or don&#039;t know how to get it.<br />
And if you learned those things nobody need to provide it for you.            </div>
