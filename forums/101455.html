                Hi<br />
  I have looked around and the setup details are not that good as I still do not know how to  setup betterbattlelog properly I am having trouble with it<br />

                Well thats not much help I can read but not follow properly if you want more people to use better<br />
battlelog you will need to have a descent tutorials.<br />
When I do them you screen shot with instructions its not hard...<br />
The instructions you have are not easy to follow and need updating especially for Mozilla.<br />
<br />
I am unable to do much at all for my clans battlelog site at all well in fact cant do anything as I have no idea what to do or how to change things, theres no instructions...<br />
<br />
Maybe I should let my members  know to forget it its not easy.<br />
You have to make things easy you should know that... <br />
And yes I know and interact with 25 different clans thats a lot of people and a lot of betterbattlelog<br />
please make it simpler <br />
thanks            </div>

Oh boy, I am usually not this guys, or at least, don&#039;t try to be this guy, but you and your friends should really consider to switch to a console. The internet is not ready for you.<br />
<br />
You mentioned Mozilla, I hope this will help you. If you need help for another browser (Chrome / Opera Next) let me know and I will adapt the manual.<br />

                I&#039;m sorry, but i can&#039;t understand you at all, if you don&#039;t explain exactly what you want we can&#039;t provide a solution for your needs.<br />
<br />
As far as i understood, you wanted to install BBLog in Firefox, which is as simple as click on the download button in the download page.<br />
<br />
But now, i definetly can&#039;t understand you.<br />
<br />
If you speak in a language that someone in the team can understand (German, French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Polish, Czech...)  you can speak in both english and that language, then someone can finally understand you.            </div>

Also the https problem and all other know problems and solutions.<br />

But the problem here is: He don&#039;t describe what&#039;s the problem exactly is. He don&#039;t say if he has installed it but cannot use it, he don&#039;t say that he can&#039;t install it.<br />
<br />
I GUESS that he have installed it, it works but he don&#039;t know how to use it or what BBLog do.            </div>

well i think that shouldn&#039;t be written in the part of &quot;know issues - firefox&quot;, because its not an issue and its not only with firefox :-P make a general part with &quot;things why BBLog doesnt work&quot;<br />
