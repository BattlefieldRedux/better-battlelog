# Better Battlelog - Worldwide Leading Battlelog Browser Addon (It will ever be)

All good things come to an end. So does BBLog. This repository hold legacy code, website data, forums and some other nostalgia stuff.

## Contribute to BBLog

Nope. There is nothing to contribute to anymore. You should've came sometime between December 2011 and May 2018 :)

## Download BBLog

Well, good things also never die. Head to directory [versions](https://github.com/brainfoolong/better-battlelog/blob/master/versions) for all ever released versions. I definetely do not recommend to take out any code reference from this, it's older than what is good for you.

But, goto [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-battlelog-bblog/kjlfnjepjdmlppapoikepbaabbghofma) to give this thing a last try, if you wish.
