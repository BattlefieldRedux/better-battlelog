                I think there are some other stats that would be beneficial to add to peoples stats pages. <br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Kill per minute for both vehicles and weapons is an important one</div>, as it&#039;s one of the few things that can&#039;t be influenced by boosting and things of that nature. For weapons, it can be somewhat influenced by playing high player count Close Quarters, but even then it&#039;s still a good measure of someones actual ability. It&#039;s even more important for vehicles. <br />
<br />
Another neat idea might be to add the Rankings from someones BF3Stats.com page, disabled vehicles per round, General Score per Minute and all of the other ones. <br />
<br />
The BF3stats.com integration is easily one of the best features of BBlog, but I think there are a few key stats that everyone would benefit to including!            </div>

                KPM already exist for weapons. For vehicles it makes less sense, imho.<br />
And for all things that bf3stats.com already have you can visit bf3stats, they should also benefit from more users.            </div>
