                Hey Brain,<br />
<br />
I do really like the forum (style, &quot;software&quot;, etc), but there is one point I miss a little bit.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to visit a forum member&#039;s twitter/youtube/battlelog/&quot;whatever is interesting in the context of the BBlog forum&quot;. Of course everything just optional, if someone doesn&#039;t want to share this information, he don&#039;t need to, but it would be (imho) really nice to have this feature.<br />
<br />
There is another tiny thing, I like the &quot;Preview&quot; button a lot, especially if I am writing novels, but it&#039;s a little bit annoying (Yeah, I know, 1st World Problems) to click two buttons if you just wrote a few words, where you don&#039;t really need to check for spelling mistakes, layout, etc. Maybe you could add the Submit button next to the Preview button?<br />
<br />
It would be awesome if you would consider these two small points, but take your time, it&#039;s not the most important feature/fixes.<br />
<br />
Thanks. :-)            </div>

                Hi,<br />
<br />
1. I guess that&#039;s nothing that should be seperated from the signature. The signature is designed to put in the most important links and texts for a user. See mine, 3 links to my projects i want to share. I be always a bit confused by hundrets of extra fields in some forums that you can fill out but 99% of all people don&#039;t use.<br />
<br />
2. I also considered that and currently i let it as it is because this force people to format the text before they post it (What i currently have done right in this post :) . But it&#039;s maybe a change for the future to optimize this preview/send process even more.            </div>

Oh snap, that makes sense, I guess. Never thought about a signature in this way.            </div>
