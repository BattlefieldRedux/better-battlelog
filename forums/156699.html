                Well, i can&#039;t get my hands off this franchise...<br />
<br />
I started development of a new extension for companion and the new forums.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s called...<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Greaterfield</div><br />
<br />
Don&#039;t know why this name, it comes to my mind first, so i took that.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">What will be different to Better Battlelog?</div><br />
<br />
In general, all. It&#039;s a whole new extension, fresh from scratch.<br />
I really don&#039;t know what will come and what i will do.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">All new development circle</div><br />
With BBLog i fully controlled the development of BBLog. This will change, somehow.<br />
Greaterfield is designed from scratch to collaborate on GitHub.<br />
All themes and plugins will also be hosted on GitHub for a seamless developer experience.<br />
The changes that made the step into the extension are controlled by me, in the first place. Maybe this will change.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Super-Raw-Early-Stage</div><br />
You can get your hands on, right now. Theme support is implemented, pretty raw and dirty, but it should work.<br />
The roadmap will be shown in the issues and wiki of github.<br />
<div class="inline post-url">https://github.com/brainfoolong/greaterfield</div><br />
<br />
A homepage also exist, but it will be pretty simple a will not contain any forums at all.            </div>
