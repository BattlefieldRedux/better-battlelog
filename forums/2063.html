I really like BBLOG so i thought i would give something back to you guys.<br />

Looks really nice. I like the clean style.<br />
But it&#039;s generally a bit to dark and the pure gray touch could be replaced with a really dark blue/gray. Apart from that the different things should be a bit better &quot;seperated&quot; with some different color variations, for example the headline in a slightly different color to normal text or so. The eye must be able to seperate sections/headlines/text easy.<br />
And a kind of big, maybe abstract, background would be very nice.<br />
Nonetheless it&#039;s a very good concept, a good basic to improve.            </div>

Hi Brain,<br />
<br />
Your response was very fast :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for providing feedback, just so I&#039;m clear on some points.<br />
<br />
1, You are looking for a dark blue/grey design, can you provide me with some color examples you may like?<br />
<br />
2, Regarding section, headlines and text, the typography i will pay more attention to in the final stages of the design but i understand what you mean :)<br />
<br />
3, Abstract backgrounds, again they come in many different forms and some examples would help a lot :)<br />
<br />
I will get back into Concept  #2 tomorrow and await your reply with some examples.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

                A layout of the home page and the feature page.<br />
<br />
The top navigation is more simply that you already have (home page)...with a sub navigation (features page).<br />
Of course, a 2 column layout can be build depending pages and content.<br />
Fonts are standard at this time...I didn&#039;t study this at this step.<br />

Allright. <br />
Forget about the colors and background. I don&#039;t know what i mean :-)<br />
Just do what you want to do. Keep your colors, keep your background.<br />
I tried a bit various colors, all looks bad. Gray is the best with a solid background, as you already done.            </div>

                It&#039;s nice to see the warm response form the community in regards to submitting designs. One thing I&#039;d highly encourage though is that the new redesign be &quot;responsive, fluid, &amp; smart phone friendly.&quot; Of course this is more on the backside in the html &amp; CSS but if your going to do it my suggestion is do it right.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t alienate your smart phone users by not making the site mobile friendly. <br />
<br />
Just a suggestion but one worth implementing while your at it.            </div>

You don&#039;t need to post your website multiple times.<br />
BBLog is designed for Desktop PCs, so the website will be built in the first line for this devices. <br />
I will have a eye for smartphone devices but a completely fluid and seamless scalable design is not that what BBLog really need.            </div>

For the little explanation, when hovering the bblog button a menu will appear with diffrent links like the features, highlights and other bblogs related things.<br />
Same with battlefield, there will be links to bf3stas.com and weapon comparison.<br />
<br />
I also made a mistake, instead of credits in the nav bar I should have write contact.<br />
<br />
I hope you&#039;ll like it even if it&#039;s not same level as what have been posted before, I still have things to learn<br />

edit: I also forgot the add a link under the older news section to access all the previous posted news but it should be there.            </div>

Yes, that what the first 2 concept authors have done is good, in quality and design idea. If you can produce your own good idea with a similar quality, make it.            </div>

Edits can be made after until you are happy :)<br />
<br />
brain can you please update my image, i have updated the same link.<br />
<br />
PS voting like this is a bad way to go forward as a large community could put votes in just for the win and i feel this is the incorrect way to go about it.<br />
<br />
There has been many hours of work put into designs and it should be chosen by the admin and mods of BBlog.<br />

i think (as i know him) he just want to see what the community like, and will take some changes in the end (like he wrote in the first post)<br />

i&#039;m not happy with the current standing because it looks like a stadard clan themplate wich is over 10 year old, but we will see wich one will be the winner.            </div>

1. The last word is made by me. The voting help us to choose the best but it&#039;s not fixed to take the best.<br />
2. Copyright protected images, sure, some designs use one. But i&#039;ll remove it in the end design. I replace it with something else that looks similar. It was my bad because i forgot it to say that i replace it with other images if someone made use of it (only for background). Sorry about that. But i think this makes no real difference for those posted designs.<br />
3. Images updated for themes.            </div>
