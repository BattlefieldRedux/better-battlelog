                The more information and stats you can provide on user stats pages, the better. Stats are always interesting.<br />
<br />
One thing that comes to my mind in the achievement and awards part of the overview, is that it would show the amount of collected ribbons (x/45) and medals (x/50). <br />
<br />
Now there is a place for latest awards, showing last 3 awards, which seems kind of pointless to me. Would rather see the awards / medals progression.<br />
<br />
What do you think?            </div>

                First point, numbers of ribbons/medals is already done. There is already a count for total ribbons to medal, total ribbons, ribbons left for new medal on this page.<br />
<br />
And the &quot;showing last 3 awards&quot; i dont know what you mean.            </div>

                Yeah, you can see the detailed awards information and the awards / ribbons progress on the awards page. I think it would be good idea to show the awards progress (collected ribbons x/45 and medals x/50) in the player stats overview page also.. I mean the &quot;main page&quot; of the player stats, showing the overview of all the stats.<br />
<br />
Right now there is &quot;latest awards&quot; slot, which feels a bit pointless.. would rather see overall awards progression as a replacement.<br />
<br />
Hope you understood what I mean.            </div>

                Yes, now i undestand. I think its a bit too much work for a point that you can get with only 1 more click.<br />
All what you want already exist, but in another pleace. For me its much work of many hours and you only must clicks once which uses 1 second :-) <br />
So, i reject this but thanks for the request.            </div>
