                What do you think about the new maps and new weapons?<br />
<br />
I think the maps are good, only on 16 players servers, i have a lot of fun with 16 players only, i dont know why there are servers with 64 players, its worst than metro!<br />
<br />
The new weapons are good, specially for Close Combat situations, i dont know why there is a lot of people complaining about these weapons when they are effective only at close or even mid ranges in some cases.  i still do prefer M16A3 or M4A1 on all situations close, mid and long ranges.            </div>

                The maps ain&#039;t that small as they said, that&#039;s a good thing. You get lost in them when you turn a wrong corner, maze ftw. :-) Nah, I like them.. it somehow reminds me to my COD time especially Conquest Domination, lol.<br />
<br />
The weapons.. what can I say? I LOVE THE SPAS!!!1! And the other weapons are also quite good. The M417 is rubbish as the other &quot;spray&quot; snipers, no one shot one kill. However the second sniper is B-E-A-UTIFUL.<br />
<br />
The whole package is great, can&#039;t wait for armored kill etc. They&#039;ve done a great job in Sweden. :-)            </div>
