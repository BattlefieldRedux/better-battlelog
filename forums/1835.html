                Hello,<br />
<br />
i  would like to suggest a plugin that posts your online battlelog status to Facebook.<br />
Somewhat like when you have joined a server, post what server you are on to your Facebook timeline.<br />
<br />
 Is playing BF3 on  and maybe a link to the battlelog server.<br />
<br />
That would have been awesome! :-)<br />
<br />
Just an idea i had to post, and didn&#039;t find any similar plugin requests.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
MrNiceGuy<br />

                I also think this would be awesome. I would like to see my upgrades and unlocks be posted to facebook, for example when I have unlocked a scope for a certain weapon or when I have taken a medal in a round. I mean the pure coolness of this option seems pretty self explanatory to me and am confused why this would not already be in the works. Surely this kind of social promotion will help migrate non playing BF3 players to BF3.<br />

Daniel obtained 46 ribbons and was a killing machine at Donya Fortress!<br />

i think that would be the most borring feature. what would your friends think? are all of them playing BF? do you think they are interessted in which ribbons you got? my girlfriend and other friends won&#039;t, i know that. maybe your friends would, maybe because all of them are playing BF, but then, they could look in Battlelog itself.<br />
<br />
as said long time ago. maybe a plugin dev will create this addon, but not the gerenall BBLog Addon.            </div>

It&#039;s why friends lists are existing, you don&#039;t have to share same content with your family and your friends !<br />
You choose what you share to which circle of friends.            </div>

                yeah that&#039;s how Facebook works, people share stuff and your friends see it. why don&#039;t you let me worry about what i deem worthy to share and what my friends will think. I think its a great option and another person here does too.            </div>
