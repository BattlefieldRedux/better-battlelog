                Is there any chance of a Mac OS-X version other than the multiple OS use for windows. As a plugin to Firefox/Chrome it would be nice to see a Mac ver. also. Since Apple converted to Intel based hardware it should be only difficult for OS specific Apple software. Browser plugins should be easier to create than complete application. Even an ios version to Battlelog would be nice since I also have iPhone and iPod Touch.            </div>

                Firefox and Chrome are both multiple OS compatible.<br />
BBLog is only a Firefox and Chrome extension. Other versions are not planned, never.            </div>

                You get from now no answer from me again. I just want to help, you piss me off. Write your own plugin and don&#039;t flame around here.            </div>

Who is not understanding here is you.<br />
<br />
BBLog is a PLUGIN/Addon for Chrome/Firefox. <div class="tag tag-b">Is totally indifferent/independent of your OS</div>.<br />
If you have an Firefox/Chrome running in your OS, BBLog will install.<br />

                on behalf of the mac community i just wanted to apologize for @SGTCAR55&#039;s ignorance. what a dousche bag.<br />
<br />
the BBlog plugin installs fine with both firefox &amp; chrome (i have it installed for both) ... on that note BL runs really slow in FF so i suggest using chrome. (FF is notorious for it&#039;s phantom memory leak)            </div>
