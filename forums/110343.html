                In the emblem editor it would be an nice feature to be able to move groups of objects all at once. That way if I put together one piece that involves several pieces and I need to move the whole thing, I can just select the pieces involved and move them all at once.            </div>

                Sry, didn&#039;t found a easy solution for that.<br />
The editor is still buggy from the battlelog side, so maybe after some time they will add such a feature natively.            </div>

                I think I thought of something that could work.<br />
There could be a record button that takes the objects state at the time record was selected and compares it to its final state when you stopped recording. <br />
So if the object started at <br />
Angle: 0<br />
ScaleX: 0.5<br />
ScaleY: 0.2<br />
Top: 160<br />
Left: 50<br />
<br />
and changed to<br />
Angle: -8<br />
ScaleX: 0.7<br />
ScaleY: 0.3<br />
Top: 170<br />
Left: 70<br />
<br />
It would store the differences in each aspect and allow you to apply them to any object that you would need to.<br />
Change angle by -8, Top by +10, left by +20, scalex by +0.2, scaley by +0.1<br />
 The scale might have to be working with percentages of the original rather than an absolute difference.<br />
<br />
Also, a zoom feature would be good. :P            </div>

                I already tested it and i had a local running solution but nothing that is really good usable.<br />
Well, let us wait some time for battlelog. <br />
I got the info they improve the editor in the next time.            </div>
