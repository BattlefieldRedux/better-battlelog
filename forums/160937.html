                Hi @ll!<br />
<br />
Because of new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in EU, all websites have to deal with new rules.<br />
<br />
Getbblog.com does have several data saved for user accounts (email, secure hashed passwords, and all data what the user have entered in profile) and additionally some tracking data for statistics.<br />
<br />
Some of that data is, somewhat, &quot;sensible&quot;. To follow all the rules of GDPR, it would take a lot of time to change the system and inform users everytime if anything changes related to their data. I had some problems with idiots, copyright and stuff like that before, as probably every &quot;bigger&quot; website does have. On the other hand, getbblog.com is in a &quot;wait for death&quot; state currently, no active development happens anymore. So, i decided to &quot;shutdown&quot; the service.<br />
<br />
What will be deleted/changed?<br />
<br />
- In one word: ALMOSTEVERYTHING :)<br />
- All data assigned to an user account will be deleted, except the &quot;username&quot;.<br />
- Password hashes and emails will be deleted<br />
- Any social media connection/reference will be removed<br />
- Profile images, banners, signatures will be deleted<br />
- Private messages will be deleted<br />
- Plugins/Themes will be deleted<br />
- Login and registration will be shut down<br />
- Forum posts and threads will not be deleted<br />
- Forum posts and threads are all read-only, as logins are shut down anyway<br />
- Google adsense/analytics will be removed<br />
- All extension APIs will be disabled. No reports, no themes, no plugins anymore<br />
- Extension itself will kept online in the chrome store<br />
<br />
What &quot;personal&quot; data do getbblog.com still collect?<br />
<br />
- Anonymized website statistics with Matomo, with anonymized IP 192.168.xxx.xxx, Do not track setting of your browser will be respected<br />
<br />

<br />
When this all will be done?<br />
Before 25. May 2018.<br />
<br />
<div class="inline font-size-200"><br />
Effectively, this all means, getbblog.com has reached the point of no return and become a site to take a look in the past, what all have been done by great people and great community.</div><br />

<br />
Thank you for your attention.<br />
