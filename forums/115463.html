                On BF3 it was possible to upload an image to battlelog and use it as a platoon emblem, could we get this feature back?<br />
I know DICE don&#039;t like it but we don&#039;t like a lot of things DICE is doing wrong now.<br />
<br />
You can use load code to copy emblems from sites like emblemsbf.com, is their any possibility to make codes for an .png or .jpg or whatever kind of image so we can paste that in &#039;&#039;load code&#039;&#039; ?<br />
Or just an: upload image option to make it really easy, it&#039;s already there but only as background, maybe change it so we can keep it and save it?            </div>

<br />
And no it&#039;s not possible to automatically convert images to a shape based code like BF use it.            </div>
