- This can also become a BBlog feature - Answer: &quot;won&#039;t include it into BBLog but its a nice addition&quot;<br />
- The elements can also be found with JQuery and that may be faster. - Done<br />

                Em, i don&#039;t know why you say it makes no sense?<br />
The plugin just make the overview for the feeds better.<br />
If anybody wants to use it, they can use it without restrictions for non plugin users.<br />
The line breaks still exist in the battlelog feeds, but not shown.<br />
The plugin only enable the line breaks for the user that uses this plugin.<br />
<br />
Thats the main part of bblog, make things better and more usefull for the user :-)<br />

Everyone has the ability to make a line break, and they actually use it but it is then not visible...<br />

I am happy that you find it useful! I will make it work with JQuery, that was the first step :)<br />

About featured plugins, this plugins would be scripts that are very good and well developed.<br />
Tiny scripts like yours without much functionality are not for featured plugins.            </div>
