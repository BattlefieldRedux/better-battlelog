                Hey,<br />
<br />
So I have this idea for a while: It would be cool if you could order all your friend in seperate groups, so that you can easier find someone, or know who someone is since the are guys that constantly change their name.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy and small idea, hope you like it ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
