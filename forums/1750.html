                1. Increase the friend maximum from 150 to at least 250. Myself and many others have already maxed out friend limits and can no longer add more people.<br />
<br />
2. Fix the issue with pending friend request. It&#039;s annoying when I can no longer send out friend requests because I have too many pending, yet I can still accept them from others.<br />
<br />
3. Fix the battlelog party system. Increase the cap from 8 to 10 at least and make it so whenever someone goes offline they automatically leave the party. It&#039;s annoying when someone takes up a spot and they aren&#039;t even online, especially when they are the party leader.<br />
<br />
4. Not being able to comment on platoon posts if you are not friends with the poster. If you are a member of a platoon and you are not friends with someone that posts on the platoon wall you cannot comment on that post. You should be able to post regardless if you are a member of the platoon and ESPECIALLY of you are a leader.<br />
<br />
5. The alert system. Sometimes when you are online you get an alert and you click on the little update logo and it won&#039;t tell you what the alert was for. It will notify you every time something comes up, but it won&#039;t always tell you what it is.<br />
<br />
6. Add the option to leave a disabled platoon, you shouldn&#039;t be trapped in it, whether it was inappropriate or not.<br />
<br />
7. Fix the flame radar. It doesn&#039;t work properly as it should. it&#039;s supposed to flag threads those on your radar posted in but it doesn&#039;t show anything <br />
<br />
I also made a thread on battlelog about this:<br />

Please consider my ideas            </div>

                This is the forum for Better Battlelog, we can&#039;t do anything about 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Only DICE can change those.<br />
<br />
Point 6 on the other hand, that one we should be able to do. I can&#039;t make any promises but I&#039;m pretty sure BBLog can handle it. Point 7 is a BBLog feature so that&#039;s a bug, will most likely be fixed in the next version of BBLog (2.0).            </div>

                Signed what jumpy says. 7 is a bug and should be fixed in 2.0<br />
6 is under consideration.<br />
