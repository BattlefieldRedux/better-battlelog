                I know of the Platoon friends here already but its does not work like i would like.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have one where it shows all members of the platoon in the sidebar.<br />
Also allow the user to select only certain platoons rather then defaulting all of them there.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance            </div>

                I would really really like to see such a plugin... because i dont want to add any Platoonmember... It would be a very cool feature... Maybe the Guy from the &quot;Dice in the sidebar&quot; Plugin can do it...            </div>

                Hi, with the recent addition of a configuration window in DiceFriends, it will now be possible for me to support any platoon instead of just the Official DICE.<br />
<br />
I am working on a new version that will support any platoon, stay tuned!            </div>

                Here is a first version : <div class="inline post-url">https://raw.github.com/azixMcAze/DiceFriends/platoon/DiceFriendsPlugin.js</div><br />
<br />
The configuration of the platoon can be easier but it works for the moment<br />
(you have to copy and paste the platoon ID in the settings window of the plugin)<br />
Please tell me if you have any problem<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Important Note :</div> This plugin is modification of Dice Friends. You have to disable Dice Friends if you want to use it. You cannot use both plugin. I will fix that in a future release<br />

It would be possible to add this feature, but it would no be easy to make a nice interface to configure it. I will first try to improve the configuration of the platoon and in the future allow to add individual players            </div>
