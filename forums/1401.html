                Hey,<br />
looking at the source of the Awards page, the progress bar they have put behind each medal is represented by a number 0-100.<br />
could you maybe put this at the top of each medal. I like to know how close i am to getting something, and not just a general &#039;almost there&#039;.<br />
<br />
also, could you sort the medals? it seems very weird that the MVP ribbons &amp; medals arent together etc... It makes it very difficult to find something, when you have to mouse over each image and see what it is.            </div>

                I will add the percentage number to each medal. <br />
But a sorting of medals is a heavy job, many people requested that medals overview is annoying.<br />
I think i must do some improvements on this page.<br />
I don&#039;t know what i will exactly integrate, but anything is coming, like sorting (as you would), mouseover highlights or so...<br />
Keep watchin for updates.            </div>

                I see you somehow sorted the ribbons and medals. Can you sort them this way <div class="inline post-url">http://postimage.org/image/8zmq8byqb/full/</div> ? I think it&#039;s best this way because the class specific and round type specific awards are together now and it&#039;s much easier on the eye to see what type of player someone is.<br />
<br />
Of course this shouldn&#039;t be top priority and if it&#039;s too much trouble, don&#039;t bother with it.            </div>

                Thanks for the idea, but this is truelly to much work :-).<br />
And i think it does not matter which sort is choosen, everybody must know where the place of the medals/ribbons is. When i use your sorting, also nobody - except you - knows which ribbon is on which place.<br />
For this reason it&#039;s to much work for a &quot;nearly none&quot; improvement, but thanks for your graphics and idea.<br />
