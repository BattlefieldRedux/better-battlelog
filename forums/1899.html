                Nice that someone made this plugin :)<br />
I&#039;ll be using it for sure, I&#039;ll use a local version, though, the icons doesn&#039;t fit my taste.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll send you my images when I&#039;ve made them, if you like them you can use them.            </div>

                I managed to throw throw together two very simple* icons, a green and red orb.<br />
The red orb is made as an APNG (Animated PNG), way better than GIF if you ask me, but Chrome doesn&#039;t support it, only Firefox and Opera does as far as I know.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll include three files in the attached ZIP folder.<br />
1. Green Orb (PNG)<br />
2. Red Orb (PNG)<br />
3. Red Orb (APNG)<br />
<br />
If you use these I think you should maybe modify the text size and the icon/text placement a little bit, just to make it look better.<br />

Battlelog and the other EA server are different one. If battlelog works, the EA server could be down too.            </div>

                It should be possible, however I have no clue how. Pun1a will figure this out, maybe he can make three plugins, one for PC, one for PS3 and one for XBOX? Or maybe he can merge them.<br />
<br />
I based the &#039;it should be possible&#039; by looking at the code from the ea site;<br />

                Guys, I&#039;m back. My account didn&#039;t really worked, don&#039;t know why.<br />
Anyway, I had and still have much to do at school, my school degree<br />
is in sight and I have to concentrate at it. But tomorrow I will take the time to update all my plugins!            </div>

                I created my own version of the plugin. It&#039;s not done yet but it shows you the up/down/stressed status of the EA server. Currently only for PC but that will change in the future.<br />

late answer to this point but sorry. this answer is a little bit &quot;stupid&quot;<br />
if battlelog is down, you don&#039;t need a Plugin to see that, because you can&#039;t visit / open Battlelog anyway.<br />
it makes only sense to show the status of EA servers, not of battlelog.            </div>

It only shows the status of the Gameservers - not the battlelog servers.<br />

                It&#039;s not working for me but the TS3 plugin wasn&#039;t working either and it was a problem with the skillmonster link so maybe it&#039;s the same problem with this one.            </div>
