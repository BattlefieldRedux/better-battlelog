                Since there are so many weapons to choose from I decided to challenge myself to get 100 kills with each one of the hand-held weapons.  I currently have at least 100 kills with every rifle, smg, lmg, pistol, shotgun.  The only ones I&#039;m currently less than 100 are IGLA, Stinger and Javelin but I&#039;m getting close.  It&#039;s a fun way to thoroughly experience each and every weapon!            </div>

<br />
100 kills, all weapons but the rockets.  (Smaw and RPG completed)<br />

                In my opinion 100 kills with each weapon is way to easy. I had that month ago.<br />
<br />
But here is my suggestion:<br />
Small arms Master <br />
- get at least 100 kills with each handheld weapon (inkluding stingers, RPG, M320)<br />
- get at least 500 kills with each weapon (Weapon Master Dogtag - except explosives, vehicles, pistols)<br />
+ get 10,000 headshots<br />
<br />
Should be hard enough to challenge most :)<br />
