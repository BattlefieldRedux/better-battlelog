                As I find these, I&#039;ll list them here. BBlog 2.2.0 - Firefox.<br />
<br />
Let me also point out that I couldn&#039;t see any obvious difference in any accuracy chart between first shot hipfire prone and first shot hipfire standing. The difference is small so I didn&#039;t mention it or check on a per-weapon basis beyond the first few, but it may be inoperative as well.<br />

                You are right.<br />
Thanks for this detailed report.<br />
I don&#039;t know why this could happen but i have a bugfix tomorrow.<br />
<br />
But the data for suppressed/tact pistols isn&#039;t available for us. Therefore no extra information to this weapon.            </div>

                Symthic has the data for the pistol laser / suppressors. If you go to the weapon comparison page, the appropriate pistols list suppressor and laser sight as their attachments and can be chosen there.<br />
<br />
ex: <div class="inline post-url">http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G17&amp;attc1=Laser+sight&amp;wep2=MP443&amp;attc2=Suppressor</div><br />
<br />
Thanks for looking into this. The weapon attachment and accuracy plot chart is easily my favorite part of BBlog. Not even Symthic lets me put multiple accessories on and evaluate the results.<br />
<br />
I know this isn&#039;t the place for it, but while I have your ear, may I suggest that at some point, the ADS / Hip Fire accuracy values get added as well? Heavy barrel / foregrip / laser sights all adjust these values and while they do show up on the accuracy chart, the numeric values themselves are not available on the weapon page.            </div>

                Ok about pistols, don&#039;t seen this before. I always expected a seperate weapon entry because it&#039;s also i different weapon (and not attachment to a weapon) on battlelog.<br />

On the Symthic pages, ADS is different per gun (defines how much spread your weapon will have versus firing from hip, in various stances). ADS is affected by various attachments, especially foregrip (which makes ADS worse). These values are accounted for in the BBlog accuracy charts (or I assume they are), but the values themselves are not visible.<br />
<br />
Example: ADS spread for normal AKS-74u is 0.4. With heavy barrel, it&#039;s 0.1. If you add a heavy barrel on the accuracy plots, the accuracy gets better, but the only way to see the actual ADS value improvement is on the Symthic site itself.<br />
<br />

<br />
Just a &quot;nice to have&quot; feature at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
Thanks for this and the speedy fix!            </div>

                Spread values already generated and calculated and the background for attachments.<br />
All modifiers for attachments on symthic already implemented in the chart.<br />
But they are not shown at the moment, as you said.<br />
Maybe i make it visible in the future.            </div>
