                Seems like a good assignment.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure about the name however. Secondary weapons are the handguns, doesn&#039;t seem fitting seeing as none of the requirements are directly classed as weapons. Also, it might come an assignments specially for handguns/secondary in the future, who knows.<br />
<br />
IMHO, it should be called something more in the ways of:<br />
- When all else fails<br />
- Last resort<br />
<br />
You get the idea :P            </div>

                My Englisch is not so good the name &quot;When all else fails&quot; sounds great!<br />
<br />
it is hard i know but is fun! i have a blast with it :) campers are doomed too get a eodbot finishing off ^^<br />
<br />
I hope that it will come it is a assignment that you will not have in a second like &quot;allrounder&quot; and that sounds fun too do<br />
for the allrounder i needed also a couple of weeks to do it.<br />
<br />

otherwise its not important where you aim, you just have to know how you have to push/click ;-)<br />
<br />
i like all the youTube Videos where small childerns try to describe you have to &quot;shoot&quot; with the defibrillator in their head and the hole video its not working xD            </div>

Dont forget we dont have all handguns that battlelog shows us, we dont have the &quot;M1911 S-TAC&quot;<br />
<br />
So if you do something like get ... with every handgun that does not work because we dont have this one :)            </div>

It should be challenging and take a while. And 100 you can reach in a few hours on metro for example.<br />
This is one of the easiest assignments imho.            </div>
