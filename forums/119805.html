                Is there currently a working plugin which shows the average rank of each team on a selected server?<br />
Added this: <div class="inline post-url">https://github.com/NikkiLoveGod/Nooblook</div> but I believe it&#039;s out dated?<br />
Thanks!            </div>

                For BF4 this doesn&#039;t work because there isn&#039;t a playerlist anymore on the serverbrowser page, which was the base for the calculation. Make this working this requires some extra requests for each selected server and that&#039;s one of the things that we try to avoid.            </div>

No player list, but now they have a REST endpoint to get server info. It is an additional request, but regardless I&#039;ve updated the code to make it work. You can install with this URL: <div class="inline post-url">https://cdn.rawgit.com/johntron/Nooblook/master/nooblook.js</div><br />
<br />
Note: Requires a recent version of Chrome (may work in other browsers).            </div>

Tried it, it periodically (1sec) adds another rating under the first one, so after a couple of seconds you get this: <br />

                If mine works and yours doesn&#039;t, here&#039;s the only things I can come up with:<br />
Different browsers - I&#039;m using the latest version of Chrome.<br />
Browser cache - Try refreshing while holding down shift.<br />
BBlog cache - I&#039;m not aware of one, but I don&#039;t know much about bblog. Try deleting and adding the plugin again.<br />
CDN delay - Maybe rawgit.com took a really long time to update. Try refreshing cache.<br />
<br />
Sorry, wish I could help more, but don&#039;t really have enough info.            </div>
