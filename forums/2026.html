                Pls dont forget, a player can have more than one account. i would include the cheat-o-meter to the general stats page. with a barometer like this:<br />
<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://battlelog-cdn.battlefield.com/public/profile/bf3/stats/stats-kd-bg.png</div><br />

on the left side 0% on the right side 100%.<br />

you should just find a good place on the stats page xD            </div>

                Little bug in it. When a player has got not enough playtime it doesn&#039;t show a percentage, but a whole line of text. When you click on the text it directs you to the cheat-o-meter site. See screen below.            </div>

                I like the plugin! I just got one problem. In your screenshot looks everything fine, but with the <div class="tag tag-b">Dark Theme by Hille - Mod by Juress</div> theme I use it looks like this: <div class="inline post-url">http://localhostr.com/file/1lGxbk3gdbUT/cheatometer.png</div><br />
<br />
After I figured out that it looks good in your screenshot I tested all themes and that is the only one what is kind of broken. Unfortunately that&#039;s my favorite.<br />

Any idea how to fix it?<br />

Without the possibility to destroy other themes, no. This is a bug of the theme.            </div>

I&#039;m thinking about it, but I would only add this &quot;feature&quot; to the stats page. The percentage will stay at the profile.<br />
<br />
<blockquote><div class="user">Mal Praktis wrote:</div>Could you please provide how the percentage is calculated?</blockquote><br />
I get the information by this website: <div class="inline post-url">http://www.team-des-fra.fr/CoM/bf3.php</div><br />
Maybe I can read the data of that page, but I&#039;m thinking about an own algorithm. BF3Stats.com gives much informations for something like this.<br />
<br />
Anyway, currently you can click on the percentage and you get redirected to the Cheat-O-Meter page.            </div>

                Pointless isn&#039;t the right word to me. It would be a lot of work and you would be waiting a very long time and it might also get his script banned from connecting to that site.<br />
Think about it. You go to look at a server with 64 players. The script would have to get the cheat info from all 64. Now multiply that by a few 100 other BBL users per hour.<br />

I&#039;ll PM you, dlconnor1979, with something else that can help.<br />

                @Patschi  -  Thanks.  I knew they came from the page/site that is linked to the plugin.  When I go to <div class="inline post-url">http://www.team-des-fra.fr/CoM/bf3.php?p=Mal-Praktis-67</div> I see a lot of numbers from a lot of different calculations.  Most of them are straight forward. <br />
 <br />
<br />
HK Ratio = number of kills / number of hits<br />
HsK Ratio = number of kills / number of headshots<br />
Kills per minute = number of kills / number of minutes equipped with weapon<br />
Accuracy = number of hits / number of shots fired <br />
<br />
Cheat Probability = ?????  What goes into this statistic?<br />
<br />
I am just wondering how the cheat probability is calculated.  What is the equation used?<br />

                Thanks for the assistance with trying to determine HOW this cheat probability percent works.  For me it is just a bit of statistical noise if I don&#039;t understand how the probability is calculated.  I really like the site the data is pulled from as it gives a very nice breakdown of all the key stats and percentages I would like to see.  <br />
<br />
I just check out that other BF3 cheat-o-meter site.  Thanks for the link.  Interesting stats shown at the bottom, but not any reference on what is unusual about them.  Why are they interesting, what is the range or point of reference for them?  Does anybody know?            </div>

                Lately when I check someone and it the result on the site is:<br />
This player has not played enough for its stats to be analyzed.<br />

Thank you Pun1a....very cool feature you have going.<br />

Hope you have the time to implement this for PS3 et al. platforms.<br />

                Any idea when the extra text bug will be fixed?<br />
Some times at the end of the name it&#039;ll add &quot;Chat&quot; or &quot;Add as friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
So far the only thing I found is that if <div class="tag tag-b">form</div> is being used then it works. But if it&#039;s just <div class="tag tag-b">button</div> or <div class="tag tag-b">div</div><br />
<br />
If there is some way you can you get it stop looking at <div class="tag tag-b"></div> then it should work.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how much trouble that would be to do.<br />
I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because of the Battlelog web site being updated or something you did to this version of the script compared to previous version but some how it got seriously broken.            </div>

The Anti-Cheat Website edits their page too often, that&#039;s the reason why this strange text appeared. Now it&#039;s fixed.<br />

Nope, I won&#039;t integrate it. Have fun.            </div>

                This is a complaint. Of sorts.<br />
I know you didn&#039;t write the script, Pun1a, but you actively encourage server admins to rely on it which I cannot endorse.<br />
How the script calculates cheating probability is elusive at best, and illogical to the point where I can not fathom how any server admin considers this a help against cheaters.<br />
<br />
Apparently all it does is take the headshot per-kill ratios and defines what they consider a &quot;normal&quot; ratio for each weapon class.<br />
For this reason, I get a <div class="inline post-url">http://www.team-des-fra.fr/CoM/bf3.php?p=I_am_shreebles</div><br />
<br />
The script thinks that a HS/K ratio of more than 32% is too high with an AR, and for carbines and PDW&#039;s its 30%. This is ridiculous. You cannot compare the HS/K ratio of an AS-VAL with that of a MP7, yet for both the value is 30%. The AS-VAL has a rapid climb and high ROF, even if you aim for the body the recoil will give you Headshots all the time. What does it have to do with cheating? <br />
<br />
To get kills with PDWs that have either low DMG or low ROF is to get headshots. That&#039;s the point. The AS-Val would be useless without headshots. <br />
<br />
I have tried it with a ton of battlelog friends and the highest I&#039;ve seen for them was like 8%. I have tried it with people that I have suspected of cheating in the past and it shows 0.1% for them. Because they only use ARs, and they shoot mostly bodyshots all of the time. If they have a wallhack, they can know when to shoot where. They will still do bodyshots because headshots are harder to get. Besides with guns like the M16 or 416 they don&#039;t need to headshot, they have low recoil and high damage so it&#039;s no problem to get 4-5 body hits in a row.<br />
<br />
Can someone show me the profile of an actual cheater where this stupid tool actually works?<br />
I&#039;ve tried people from the global leaderboards, the highest I&#039;ve seen was 8%. And with those people you would actually have a damn good reason to suspect them of cheating (most global headshots EVER?)<br />
<br />
I consider myself a good player, sometimes great, but in no way good enough to suspect me of cheating. I have friends with a much higher K/D and SPM that have less than 5% &quot;cheat probability&quot;.<br />
<br />
What does a cheater do? He shoots people in the head, he is always faster than them, he knows where everyone is, and he does not die because he sees everyone who tries to sneak up on them. He can run through a server and kill everyone in less than a minute. He likes guns that he doesn&#039;t have to reload because with the hacks, any gun will be 100% accurate. So the stats of a cheater would be: Very high K/D, very high SPM, high H/K ratio, uses LMGs a lot, and maybe ARs. But not PDWs (lower DMG, lower mag size usually).<br />
<br />
So please,<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Server admins. Do not rely on this tool. What it calculates is absolute bullshit. Detecting a cheater is not so easy, this tool only makes it worse for people who play legitimately.</div><br />

While not endorsing Cheat-O-Meter, but to answer your question...<br />
<br />
Testing it, I googled for someone complaining about being punk busted:<br />
punk buster site:http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/en/forum/<br />
The first and only check of such a post, the poster had a rating of 24.5%.<br />
I was fairly sold.<br />
<br />
Both Cheat-0-meter&#039;s are down at the moment (10-17-12) so can&#039;t find any scores.<br />
<br />
Cheat-0-Meter&#039;s never show up on a users profile page for me, so I copy and paste<br />
names (no easy feat runnng better battlelog)  to <div class="inline post-url">http://www.team-des-fra.fr/CoM/bf3.php</div><br />
or <div class="inline post-url">http://cheatometer.hedix.de/</div> almost to a person they come back .1% the very first check<br />
<br />
I figure a name needs to be entered once, then it&#039;s tracked from that time on. Mine went<br />
from 0.1% on the first check to 8.something% a few days later - my higher score <br />
came from the damage caused by the weapons I used (no clue). I&#039;ve never cheated<br />
on an online game, and have no plans of ever doing so.<br />
<br />
But no, used alone the scores are a novelty; used in conjunction with other data could<br />
swing a decision.            </div>
