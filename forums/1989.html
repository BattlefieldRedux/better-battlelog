                I&#039;m often in the situation, that i meet a hacker or a massive camper on a server. I often forgot their name so i cant add them to playerradar or report them in battlelog, if it is a hacker. Sometimes you even cant find them in the Battlereport. So i would like to have the ability to do this ingame, for example: writing !radaradd (Name) in the chat.. Is it possibly?            </div>

                No, BBlog only affects the webpage battlelog, not the game Battlefield 3.<br />
If you want to add a hacker to the radar asap, just alt+tab from the game, click on the name of the server in the gamemanager (bottom left) - find the hacker in scoreboard, go to his profile and apply the radar.            </div>
