                i have a simple request.<br />
you should bring back the old BBlog language system, because the real Battlelog is useful only in english and is simply useless in Italian(i don&#039;t know other languages), because the Italian Battlelog doesn&#039;t receive the latest news(there are only 3 news since the Battlelog opened) and doesn&#039;t have its own forum(if you want use it you have to set the Battlelog in english)<br />
<br />
i used the old BBlog in italian while i was using the Battlelog in english and it was very useful, but now i have to choose between one or the other.            </div>

                That&#039;s one of the simplification things in BBLog v3.<br />
Sry if you used it differently. We do not put it back again.            </div>
