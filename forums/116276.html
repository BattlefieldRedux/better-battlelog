                So, as many of you guys know I had a poor computer than somehow managed to run BF3 and even BF4 at 15-30 FPS, you know, the athlon with the 5670...<br />
<br />
I dropped any interest in both BF3 and BF4 some months ago because lets face it, i couldn&#039;t even play those games decently, but, after 6 months of hard work online i bought this beauty:<br />
<br />
GA-970A-D3P<br />
FX-6300<br />
R9-270X<br />
8 GB of RAM at 1333Mhz<br />
Other crappy stuff i already had...<br />
<br />
And I haven&#039;t tried Battlefield yet so I dont even know how it will run even with DirectX, does anyone in here have tried AMD&#039;s API to give me some info about what to expect in terms of performance? is BF4 enjoyable? is it crap?...            </div>

                I&#039;d say you&#039;re gonna average 60fps no problem on full HD medium-high on mantle. That CPU is very good and going mantle with 270X has to be great.<br />
<br />
You can push that CPU to 4,5GHz no problem with a midrange $30 cooler.            </div>

                Well, yeah, I guess, the MB is really crappy since its an entry level one, I dont think I should OC in that thing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what about the game? is it shit? the last thing I remember was the rage this game caused because of the bad netcode COD style, is it fixed now?            </div>

<br />
The netcode is abyssmal, so unless they fix it or you can get the game for really cheap, I&#039;d say hold off :)<br />
Other than that it ain&#039;t that bad.            </div>

<br />
Well, thay have more than one job, but whatever... :P<br />
<br />
Anyways you should reach 60+ FPS at 1080p on High with no problem with Mantle, hell probably even on Ultra but 60FPS constant I&#039;d say it&#039;ll be hard.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t tested Mantle myself as they&#039;re still only available on the Beta Drivers, many people had a boost, very few didn&#039;t.            </div>

                Well, fuck me, i just bought it on Ebay for 23$, I&#039;m waiting for the seller to send me the key, I never had money to buy games as freely as I have now (BBLog has been a big push for me to find jobs online in the past few months), and if I save it forever I wont enjoy it, right? ;).            </div>
