                As it is now, I feel like the following things make the general Loadout view a bit inconsistent and hard to use effectively:<br />
<br />
- The underbarrel attachment is not shown underneath the weapon like barrel attachment, secondary attachment and optic: would be nice to have a 2x2 grid below the weapon instead of the 1x3 used at the moment.<br />
-  No attachments are shown for handguns: 1x3 grid could be enough to show everything and would fit nicely.<br />
- Only half ot the attachments for vehicles is shown (1x4 grid): would be nice to have a second row underneath the one already there so we can see them all (2x4 grid).<br />
<br />
I really can&#039;t understand why these things aren&#039;t in the vanilla Battlelog. Why not show everything, but only certain attachments? What was the rule they used to choose?            </div>

                To change something in the loadout view is very difficult because with mostly every battlelog update this feature will be broken because they change often things in the loadout.<br />
<br />
For that reason we currently will not integrate a loadout view change in bblog.            </div>

                Well, since I need to do a lot more digging into the loadout backend on battlelog (for my loadout sets plugin), and since I was asked nicely in the other thread, I&#039;ll look into these tweaks.... but as is warned by BrainFooLong above, anything I throw together even in plugin form is likely to get eaten alive by the next battlelog update!            </div>
