                Hi.<br />
I have two suggestions. The first is to include a BB code editor on the platoon presentation editor. (Sorry if this has already been mentioned)<br />
<br />
The second is to allow any flash video (not just youtube) to be embedded on a platoon page, with width and height parameters. Perhaps this could be implemented with a regular hyperlink to the flash file, with html parameters, e.g. &quot;http://www.example.com/flash/flash.swf?w=640&amp;h=480&quot; ?<br />
<br />
This could be enabled on a per-platoon basis if there are any security concerns.<br />
<br />
Thanks.            </div>

                Hi!<br />
<br />
First, this isn&#039;t possible by battlelog. All users without bblog installed will see only the codes itself. The not translated by battlelog (like in forum posts).<br />
<br />
Second, to embed SWF files could be a security break and some people could turn it into very bad things.<br />
So also a SWF isn&#039;t really a functional video, it could also be a game and many more.<br />
To unsecure to implement, some people could grab account data and many more with swf files.<br />
<br />
So, twice rejected.            </div>

                So there is no chance of flash embedding as a default off option that can be turned on under advanced settings with a disclaimer?            </div>
        </div>

                The risk is to high. 80% of user read no disclaimer and warnings, and than 9 from 10 flame around because there account was hacked or anything is broken :-)<br />
Sorry, there are good reasons why all great social media sites block external flash by default and allow only 100% secure links.            </div>

                Fair enough. (I&#039;m not sure about you calling Battlelog a great social media site though!)<br />
My dream of a platoon pong game will have to stay as an external link ;)<br />
