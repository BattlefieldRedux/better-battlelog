                When you look at someone&#039;s profile it&#039;ll show you what server they are on but that&#039;s all. You can click on that server name / link and join from the following page. But if you want to join on that person they either have to be a friend of yours or you have to work a bit harder to be able to it (explained below).<br />
<br />
So why am I asking for this. As a server admin with a server that run a 24/7 Metro we all know that despite DICE fixing 1 of the glitches that allowed people to get in the ceiling there are 2 others that I know of. As a good server admin instead of just taking people at their word that someone is up there I like to try to get a screen shot of it so if they try to dispute it we have proof that says other wise.<br />
<br />
Here is what I&#039;ve been having to do as it is:<br />
I go to the server&#039;s page on Battlelog and find the glitcher.<br />
Click on the glitcher&#039;s name which takes me to his stats page.<br />
From there I have to go to his Profile page (this part I&#039;m ok with so far).<br />
Now I click on the friend&#039;s list and pick on of his friends at random.<br />
On that person&#039;s Profile page I click on the friend&#039;s list again.<br />
This will show me that the offender is playing and what server and includes a Join button along side the &quot;Add as friend&quot; button<br />
I&#039;m now able to join directly on the glitcher&#039;s team and in their squad even if it&#039;s locked.<br />
<br />
A cheap and dirty mock up of what I had in mind.<br />

Not my profile. No idea who the person is. I just picked it at random, hence wiping out their name and other identifying information.            </div>

Isn&#039;t there already a button to join?<br />

Only for friends. I think DICE removed the &quot;Join&quot; button few Battlelog updates ago. Dunno why.            </div>
