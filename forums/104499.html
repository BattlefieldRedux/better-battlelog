Just checked his profile out of curiosity and the Banned labels are gone. Can anyone else confirm that? I am confused now. Why should he get unbanned?            </div>

i stoped the discussion about cheaters with EA. it makes no sense to talk about because they will never take really care about this problem.            </div>
