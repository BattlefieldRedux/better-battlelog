                Removes various elements in BattleLog. For BattleField 4 Only.<br />
Previously knows as &quot;BBLog-Remove-Buy-BattlePacks&quot;<br />
<br />
Github Link: <div class="inline post-url">https://github.com/XjSv/BBLog-Additional-Enhancements</div><br />
<br />
This is a new plugin which is an expansion of &quot;BBLog-Remove-Buy-BattlePacks&quot;. The old plugin (BBLog-Remove-Buy-BattlePacks) will be retired and this one will take it&#039;s place.<br />
This plugin includes the option to remove the &quot;BUY BATTLEPACKS&quot; box in the Battlepacks page and the option to remove the sidebar in the landing page.<br />
<br />
Original Thread: <div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com/en/board/topic/132320/1/Remove-BUY-BATTLEPACKS-in-BattlePacks-Page</div> (deprecated)<br />
<br />
I expect more features to be added to this in the future.            </div>

                Yeah sorry about that. I coded it but did not have time to test it. I just tested it now and published in the Plugin Gallery. Admin needs to approve it first though before it becomes available.<br />
<br />
It also took a little longer because i wanted to consult the admin about renaming the plugin.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that i did not want to maintain 2 plugins. Plus whats the point of 2 plugins when 1 can do the job of both. <br />
<br />
Anyways it&#039;s waiting for the admins approval right now. <br />
Also waiting for the admins approval is the deletion of the old plugin.            </div>

                Shall I rather use the file from here (when it&#039;s published) or the one from GitHub? Does it matter?            </div>

                Well you can take the file from GitHub if you want until it gets approved. <br />
Also I still need to figure out how to implement the tile hiding. Such as the premium box for example.<br />
<br />
Do those tiles usually change? <br />
I&#039;m wondering should I make them hide by name or by number in case the content or order changes.<br />
Meaning should the option be to hide tile #3 or the premium tile?            </div>
