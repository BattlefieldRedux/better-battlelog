                So I just downloaded the BBlog and activated it, but for some reason it refuses to work properly. I have the latest version of Firefox, and the latest version of the BBlog add-on.<br />
I have all the other add-ons working perfectly but BBlog is missing. And I just made a new Firefox profile since it has been told so in the FAQ list.<br />
I&#039;ll add the pics of my Firefox version and BBlog version too, and what my Menu Bar looks like.<br />
I couldn&#039;t find any other problems like this even from up to page 5, unless there was one or two with wrong text on them.<br />
<br />
Any help here, since there doesn&#039;t seem to be anything for this yet?            </div>

                S&#039;up Honest? Sorry to get your hopes up fella, but I&#039;m having the exact same trouble. I&#039;ve got an inkling that I&#039;ve &#039;denied&#039; some thing in Firefox. But I cannot for the heck think what it is.<br />
I&#039;m running 16.1 on a fresh install too.<br />
<br />
ANY help would be greatly appreciated as I use BBlog A LOT!<br />

                Hi, thanks for your time. I have also firefox 16.0.1 now. (updated last night ;-~ )<br />
I hope these are the SS&#039;s you need. I did the &#039;file find&#039;, backed it up then removed it from the relevant folder. Waited a short time, restarted Firefox, but, I&#039;m afraid the same problem occurs. No Better Blog :-(<br />

                I followed all the steps told in that post. I have deleted that file from the extensions section. I downloaded BBLog again. And checked everything. There seems to be nothing new. Nothing differs from what I saw before doing that. Usually when I delete a file or a folder from my system my comp goes crazy. But nothing happened when I got rid of that file. I don&#039;t know what is wrong or is this a new kind of a problem, or maybe I have missed something really simple. And yes I did start Firefox again after that and do the other stuff I needed to do.<br />
But what should I do now?<br />
<br />
[color=#BF0000]EDIT: I Updated BLog 9 times and started FF 4 times again.<br />
BBLog appeared....<br />
Finally.......  Okay. Case closed :d[/color]            </div>

Yea I realised that, but I took the link too. I took the pic from Moh back then. But the normal didn&#039;t make any difference either. And I couldn&#039;t access BLog from anywhere before tons of restarts and adjustments            </div>

                I had the same problem all of a sudden (after I closed the tab and opened a new one) and I was really clueless until I took a look at the URL. I was redirected to <div class="inline post-url">https://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/</div> It seems that the protocol is not supported and so the add-on didn&#039;t showed up.<br />
<br />
Maybe this will help people with the same problem because I was a few minutes brain fucked. ;-)            </div>
