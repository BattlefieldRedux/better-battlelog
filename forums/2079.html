I don&#039;t add a donate button because i don&#039;t want ask for donations. BBLog is donation free. People should spend their money to their own things.            </div>

i like this because i hate MOH.<br />
otherwise, why is Medal of Honor integrated in Battlelog? BATTLElog have todo with BATTLEfield, so, Medal Of Honor should have their own MOHlog, like Need for Speed have their own AUTOlog.            </div>

I just say that i not buy the game because i don&#039;t like it. That&#039;s all. And when i don&#039;t have the game, i cannot give people the support for it because i don&#039;t have access to all parts of Battlelog in MOH:W. What is here selfish?<br />
<br />
Why should i buy the game for 60&euro; when i don&#039;t like it? Only to give other people support? Come on.            </div>

I never said that i don&#039;t accept donations. I only said that i do not add a button anywhere because i don&#039;t want to ask for donations. If someone really want donate, there is always a way to contact me. Selfish is the totally wrong word what you used. Or do you really want to say that the BBLog project is selfish in any way?            </div>

                Hey there. BBlog works fine on the moh side. There was a little problem with uploading images to platoons. I made some little changes in the code but since this is not a custom plugin I don&#039;t know where to post it. Maybe PM to you? Probably I&#039;m not in the right place but actualy I didn&#039;t see where to post this, so excuse me.<br />
<br />
Kind regards. Keep your awesome work on this project mate!            </div>

                I was having many issues other than just the Platoon Emblem. Here are just a few things that are bugged for me when you&#039;re on the MoH tab with BBL installed:<br />
<br />
Clicking Server Favorites brought you back to your BF3 server favorites<br />
Clicking Forum brought you to the BF3 forum<br />
<br />
The biggest one, that I am reading a LOT about online is that stats were not saving properly, it was causing issues with ranking for me. I would rank up in game and it wouldn&#039;t save any of it. I uninstalled BBL and it&#039;s been working flawlessly since.            </div>

Maybe it&#039;s working on some pages, maybe not. Because we don&#039;t support MOH:W atm are there some bugs and thinks, wich doesn&#039;t work. And THAT&#039;S the reason for NOT SUPPORTING.<br />

And if you&#039;re ranked up ingame and in MOH:W don&#039;t it&#039;s an MOH:W problem, not an BBLog.            </div>

Maybe it&#039;s working on some pages, maybe not. Because we don&#039;t support MOH:W atm are there some bugs and thinks, wich doesn&#039;t work. And THAT&#039;S the reason for NOT SUPPORTING.<br />
<br />
And if you&#039;re ranked up ingame and in MOH:W don&#039;t it&#039;s an MOH:W problem, not an BBLog.</blockquote><br />

<br />

It&#039;s possible to hide the MOH:W activity from the Battle Feed ???<br />

it is possible, of course, but thats more an idea for an BBLog Plugin as an general BBLog feature. i would like a plugin/feature like this =)            </div>
