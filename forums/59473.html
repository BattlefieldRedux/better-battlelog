                hackers are using scripts on your better battlelog program to hack into peoples battlelog and change the platoon names and wreck there platoon and stats etc.<br />
i know its this because when i took bblog off they couldn&#039;t do it,after 3 weeks of doing it everyday.<br />
this is a serious issue and i will not put it back on until the exploits are fixed.<br />
i have no idea how they are doing it but they are.            </div>

                BBLog do nothing that you mention here.<br />
Nobody can change Platoon Stats or &quot;Wreck&quot; Platoons, it&#039;s simply impossible.<br />
It sounds more like an battlelog bug than a &quot;hack&quot;.            </div>

                1.) like brain said, its not possible.<br />
<br />
2.) you have to Install BBLog from THIS SERVER. Check that in the URL is written <div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com</div> ! The script vom BBLog is open source, so its possible that there are a few copies in the internet, but they are NOT real Better Battlelog. possible that you have installed a copy of BBLog from an other source. check this please.<br />
<br />
3.) Platoon names can be only changed if a leader or the founder wants to do this. its possible that one of your teammates renamed it...<br />
<br />
4.) ...or that one of your accounts get hacked, f.e. because you have registred you on a faked Battlelog page (f.e. &quot;Battlefield 4 Beta&quot;) or maybe one of the unofficial battlelog apps for android / iOS have stolen your account informations.            </div>

all members from his platoon were leader.<br />
as a leader you can rename platoons and change the emblem.<br />
<br />
he didn&#039;t know this and thought it was a hack.            </div>
