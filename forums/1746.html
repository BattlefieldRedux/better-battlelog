                It would be very nice to have a list of the most played maps (including also the ones from the DLCs). It would be nice to have &quot;times played&quot; and &quot;time played&quot; for each map.<br />
<br />
The best would be to have this information also for your friends (and having a proper list) and for all bf3 players to check out what are the favourite maps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention.            </div>
