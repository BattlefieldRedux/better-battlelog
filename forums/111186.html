                Would it be possible to add custom assignments or add the assignments for the new guns that DICE patched into BF4( L85, M-TAR, RPK.. etc..) I would like to see my progress instead of having to guess what i need to do to unlock these guns .. Much appreciated and hope this is possible..            </div>

Just wait two weeks until you are official able to get those guns. I am pretty sure DICE will show you the requested info. ;-)            </div>
