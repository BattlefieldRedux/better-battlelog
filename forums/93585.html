                I have updated to the newest BBLog 3.5.1 update with the new Custom Groups in Comcenter.<br />
<br />
In the comms bar, I have made a new group &amp; put certain people in it, but... how do you Delete the Group or Change the Name?<br />
What if I made a spelling mistake, or if I end up with multiple groups &amp; decide to get rid of one. Does anyone know? Any help would be appreciated. It&#039;s probably right there in front of me but i&#039;m too blind to see it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.            </div>

It&#039;s pretty easy. :-)<br />

Delete group = Hover over group, a x will appear on the right side, klick it, group deleted<br />
Rename group = No rename function integrated, you have to delete the group and create a new one <div class="tag tag-b">OR</div> you export your BBlog settings, open bblog-settings.json, search the group name, change it, save the file and import it back into BBlog.            </div>

                Oh yes, found it. Yup... right in front of me.<br />

Thank you very much for the help. Much appreciated.<br />

An Edit Group Name would be handy.            </div>
