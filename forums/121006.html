                Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been wondering if there will be BetterBattlelog support for Battlefield Hardline.<br />
<br />
As soon as the HL (HardLine) Battlelog came on screen I could tell something was missing. In BF3 &amp; BF4 I really, really like the BBLog &amp; always use the enhancements, &amp; always recommend it to players that don&#039;t have it. If it&#039;s not going to be for HL, the HL Battlelog will seem incomplete &amp; will be sorely missed because EA &amp; Dice will never do as good a job as what you guys have done BF3 &amp; 4.            </div>

                Nice. Thank you. Keep up the good work, it&#039;s all appreciated. If I understood how to write the coding &amp; values, I&#039;d help out, but unfortunately, it&#039;s way above my head. UK BTEC computer engineer level 2 course is as far as I&#039;ve got so far, about 1/4 of the way through.            </div>
