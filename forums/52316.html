                A lot of people on Battlelog forums likes the animation what comming from the last Battlelog update but they are annoying with this new messy <br />
no order, impossible to find a dogtag..<br />
<br />
Maybe BBLog can improve this page with extra filters ?<br />
<br />
- Add a &quot;locked&quot; filter = not yet unlocked (and a &quot;missing&quot; filter = not taken)<br />
- add extra filters (weapons, ribbons, stars...) <br />
<br />
An example of a possible layout<br />

<br />
An idea i&#039;ve presented in bug area but it will be more visible here (or in the plugin section if rejected)            </div>

                I don&#039;t even notice the animation, it lags so much with all dog tags so it just looks like it was before.<br />
The only time I notice the animation is if I see just a small amount of dog tags.            </div>

                I have the information that DICE do some improvement on the DogTag in the future, so i don&#039;t do changes here. Maybe they will do that what you suggested.            </div>

                I was just about to make post that was to request this as an idea (to have a &#039;locked&#039;, &#039;unloacked&#039; and/or &#039;unobtained&#039; filter that shows only dog tags that have yet to be taken or unlocked), since the original post of this request was made the DICE battlelog update hadn&#039;t addressed the issue. <br />
<br />
So rather than me making a post like this (or like the other i found) could I possible get a bump on this and re-request/suggest this as a filter. <br />
<br />
p.s., I wish I had found bblog much sooner than I did as it is awesome.            </div>
