I think you are talking about this:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://hostr.co/file/970/rrC3owQJu6SO/removefriend.png</div><br />
Just go to your friendslist, hover over your friends name and click the <div class="tag tag-b">X</div>.            </div>
        </div>

no, battlelog I mean that there is a button next to the name of the friend to remove the particular person but to give the button is not removed from the contact list page nor updating Here a image what I mean <div class="inline post-url">http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6496/deletefriendbutton.png</div> I want you hit that button to be removed instead of going to my contacts because it is easier and comfortable            </div>
