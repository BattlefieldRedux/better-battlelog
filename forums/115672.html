                Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I just wrote a small plugin that highlights your friends in the scoreboard of the full server details page. It&#039;s not particularly useful (although you can quickly see how your friends currently do on the server without searching through a scoreboard with 64 players), basically it&#039;s purpose is to get me started on bblog plugins :)<br />
<br />
Here we go:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/607872/bf-emblems/HighlightFriendsInScoreboard.js</div><br />
<br />
Testing and feedback, especially from other plugin developers, is highly appreciated!            </div>

                Pretty nice coded. Just one requirement.<br />
Don&#039;t add variables to global scope via &quot;var plugin = {...&quot; outside of the plugin itself, this override any previous declaration in the page, and especially a word like this could be used by battlelog itself in the global scope.<br />
Add it in the recommended way directly with the &quot;var plugin&quot;<br />
<br />
Like this<br />
<br />
<blockquote>BBLog.handle( &#039;add.plugin&#039;, {...} );</blockquote>            </div>

                Whoops, you&#039;re right. I just did that for debugging purposes and forgot to change it, but it&#039;s fixed now. I also updated the link.<br />
<br />
I tried to clone the &quot;join&quot;-button from the comcenter to the scoreboard, but adding the element triggers the domchange event and makes my plugin run in an infinite loop. My first attempt was to set a boolean isWorking property in the plugin object, like this:<br />
<br />
<code>	name: &#039;Highlight friends in scoreboard&#039;,<br />
<br />
	isWorking: false,<br />
<br />
	/**<br />
	 * @param instance<br />
	 */<br />
	domchange: function domchange( instance ) {<br />
		if ( !instance.isWorking &amp;&amp; instance.hasScoreboardOnCurrentPage( instance ) &amp;&amp; instance.hasActivePlayers( instance ) )<br />
			instance.highlightFriends( instance );<br />
	},<br />
...<br />
	highlightFriends: function highlightFriends( instance ) {<br />
		var friendList = Surface.C.comcenter.getFriendsListFromLs(),<br />
			joinBtnList = $( &#039;button.join-friend&#039; ),<br />
			l = friendList.length,<br />
			f, $tr, $joinBtn, $divInteract, $clone;<br />
<br />
		instance.log( &#039;Checking &#039; + l + &#039; friends...&#039; );<br />
<br />
		instance.isWorking = true;<br />
<br />
		for ( var i = 0; i &lt; l; i++ ) {<br />
			f = friendList&#91; i &#93;;<br />
			$tr = $( &#039;tr&#91;data-userid=&#039; + f.userId + &#039;&#93;&#039; );<br />
			if ( $tr.length &gt; 0 ) {<br />
				instance.log( f.username + &#039; is playing on this server, highlighting...&#039; );<br />
				$tr.find( &#039;td&#039; ).css( &#039;background-color&#039;, &#039;rgba( 0, 128, 0, 0.4 )&#039; );<br />
<br />
				// clone join button<br />
			}<br />
		}<br />
<br />
		instance.isWorking = false;<br />
<br />
	}</code><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that didn&#039;t work. Whenever the domchange event ocurred, my isWorking property was reset to false. Any suggestions?            </div>

                Yes, you reset it after you execute the code &quot;highlightFriends&quot;.<br />
That means, after the highlight you start from scratch and your code runs again.<br />
<br />
Check of the join button already exist before you add it again.<br />
Than the next domchange update don&#039;t disturb you.            </div>

Of course, the purpose is to make my plugins domchange function not do anything only while the loop is adding objects to the DOM. I thought my &quot;for&quot;-loop runs while a domchange event gets fired and my plugin starts over (parallel), triggering more domchange events.<br />
<br />

Alternative approach, gonna try that :) thanks.            </div>

                A few more tips.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t use a lazy selector like $(&quot;tr&quot;), it matches first every &lt;tr&gt; in the dom which is slow.<br />
Search a anchor before with a id, for example most of containers in battlelog have a ID. A ID is unique per HTML definiation, therefore the selector is much faster.<br />
<br />
Also you can avoid the problem with parellel runs of domchange with setting a class to a already processed &lt;tr&gt; and than check before you do something again if the class exists, if yes than skip the &lt;tr&gt;.<br />
But in your case it doesn&#039;t matter, the complete run just require a few milliseconds at max, a domchange is only triggered 200 milleseconds after a change has done in the DOM.<br />
<br />
The plugin domchange is a BBLog handler that fires not on every domchange, it fires just 200ms after the last real domchange has been done. To avoid such problem with too much calls.            </div>

Old habits die hard... I&#039;ll add that to my to-do list.<br />
<br />
<blockquote><div class="user">BrainFooLong wrote:</div>Also you can avoid the problem with parellel runs of domchange with setting a class to a already processed &lt;tr&gt;</blockquote><br />
That&#039;s pretty elegant, I will definetely give it a try.<br />

Is there some sort of documentation for these things?<br />
<br />
Nonetheless: updated. When players joined while the scoreboard was active, my selector won&#039;t work because these new elements don&#039;t get the class which I&#039;m searching for.            </div>

No, but all can be readed in the source code of BBLog itself.<br />
In this special case, i&#039;ll update the documentation of the example plugin.            </div>

                Hey there,<br />

your plugin isn&#039;t working anymore. When checking your link it says &quot;Not Found - The resource could not be found.&quot;<br />
<br />
Would be great if you can fix it, its a great plugin.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
