                What does this Soldier Radar do? I did read about it by Hovering my mouse cursor over it but i don&#039;t understand. So, I added a player/soldier to my Soldier Radar and increased it&#039;s volume, now what will it do, how will it help me?<br />
<br />
Does it let me keep track of that player and the servers he plays in, cuz that would be cool, if yes then how will i see which server that person is in and if no, then what does it do?            </div>

                If you have a user in your user radar, Better Battlelog will make a sound when you click on the same server he/she is in. The radar has nothing to do with stats nor tracking soldiers.<br />
And please note that it currently only works with Battlefield 3 and Medal of Honor Warfighter.            </div>

<br />
So to find out he/she is in which server, i would have to click every server till the Radar makes the sound? Isn&#039;t there any other way to find which server they are playing without them being in my friends?            </div>

                The server radar is meant for hackers, cheaters and people you don&#039;t like to play with. So it gives you a warning (sound) when you click the server where someone from your soldier radar is in. As I said in my previous post, it has nothing to do with stats nor tracking soldiers. :-)            </div>

                For clarification:<br />
<br />
Soldier/User Radar = Warn you (with a message next to the join server button)  when the user from your radar is currently on this server. Also there is a additional option to make sound when you viewing a server detail page with activated live scoreboard.<br />
<br />
Flame Radar = Just for the board. If a board user, that is on your radar, write a post, than the post will be hidden.<br />
<br />
Server Radar = Warn you (with a message next to the join server button) for a server that is on your radar list.            </div>
