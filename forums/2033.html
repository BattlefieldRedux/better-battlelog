                Hi!<br />
First of all thank you for Better Battlog. It is essentiel for BF3 Players, thanks!<br />
<br />
My problem:<br />
I don&#039;t see my Jet and Chopper Service Stars on my Vehicles Page:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/soldier/doping1/vehicles/351449751/pc/</div><br />
<br />
It says &quot;Shortcut Kit used&quot; instead of the Service Stars. But I did not buy any Shortcut Bundles or something, played those up legitimately.<br />
Also when I kill somebody ingame with the Jet or the Chopper, the enemy does not see my Service Stars in this vehicle while &quot;deathcam&quot; either. <br />
<br />
After a Match when the Scoreboard appears, I can display my Service Stars in the Vehicles Tab. Dogtags are also working.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Peace.            </div>

                look strange... generally if you bought shortcuts, you won&#039;t see how many service stars you have. but in this case it should be written by the unlocks &quot;shortcuts&quot; too, so i dont know whats wrong here.<br />
<br />
i think this is an Battlelog Bug. So maybe DICE can help.<br />
How does it look with deactivated BBLog? Have you than the same problem?            </div>

                When I disable bblog, it just says that i&#039;ve got everyting unlocked. Like normal without bblog.<br />
<br />
But I also guess this is a problem from DICE, because now i know why i got this problem. I bought a Premium Key on eBay. Just Premium - no Shortcut Kits. Since then my Service Stars are not displayed anymore. Also my Service Stars are not displayed in the Deathcam, so this if definately not a bblog issue. But anyway thanks for your advice, i will post on the official Battlelog forum because i&#039;m not the only one with this problem<br />
