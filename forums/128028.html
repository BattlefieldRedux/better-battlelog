                Better Battlelog has already a native feature like this included. It doesn&#039;t necessarily has the same design, but in the end the same function (Even though with Better Battlelog your comments/ratings are locally saved, and not shared with others. If I remember correctly, people requested that in the past, but was dismissed for reasons.)<br />

You can fork BSB <div class="inline post-url">https://github.com/SerDIDG/BattlelogServersBlacklist</div> and do what ever you want, but code is little bit dirty. Author of Battlelog Servers Blacklist.            </div>
