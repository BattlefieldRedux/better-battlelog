                Could you add a new column to the weapons comparison chart so you can see to which class this weapon is available?<br />
<br />
value(s) ==<br />
-assault<br />
-engineer<br />
-support<br />
-recon<br />
-pistol<br />
-shotgun<br />
<br />
You could easily select and compare all the weapons of a specific class.<br />
<br />
That would be great. Thanks.            </div>

                why don&#039;t using the already existing filter on the weapon stats page (the buttons above the table)?            </div>

                Sorry. But this is much work for just a simple faster way.<br />
You can click on the weapon rows you want (mark as orange) and than click on hide/show only highlighted entries. Than you can compare between a specifc set of weapons.            </div>

                But I want to compare all shotguns in damage or all pistols in rate of fire...<br />
<br />
It would be one simple column that you add<br />
<br />
THAT&#039;S too much work? o.O <br />
 can only imagine what work you put in battlelog overall. work of your lifetime i guess...            </div>

                No, this is not a simple column - It just looks like so.<br />
I must rework the table creation (is dynamically created by weapon data) and map &quot;classes/groups&quot; to each weapon in this table.<br />
In this is too much work because already a kind of filtering exist. Click on weapons and hide out all non marked. Than you can compare in the way you want. For example mark all pistols.<br />
You can also save the link (with marked filters) in favorites, than you can compare it every time again.<br />
And yes, i have already spent so much time for BBLog, you are right, and that&#039;s also a reason why i want to keep my work time for it as small as possible.            </div>
