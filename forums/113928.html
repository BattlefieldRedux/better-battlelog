                Would it be possible to implement a method (through a button or similar) to apply a given camo to all unlocked weapons and to all vehicles? As it is now, keeping camos consistent through all the equipment is an extremely daunting task.<br />
<br />
Also, will it ever be possible to see (and maybe even change) soldier camos in the Battlelog? Right now it can only be done ingame.            </div>

                BBLog do no changes in the loadout.<br />
Some plugin devs already made some plugins for it, take at look at the plugin section in our board.<br />
Maybe someone can made this for you.            </div>

As a random note on this, applying paint across all weapons and, independent from that, all vehicles is now thankfully integrated in vanilla battlelog/bf4.<br />

Soldier camos are a much more complicated issue. They&#039;re actually find-able in the underlying data of the page, but I haven&#039;t had a great deal of luck finding an efficient means of a) IDing which is which and b) getting changes to it to reliably stick game-side, especially since the soldier camos are per-faction, so jumping between US, CN, and RU really just makes a complicated mess of it.            </div>

</blockquote>Thank you for the in depth answer!<br />
<br />
I think another problem with soldier camos is that even ingame they get resetted nearly every time: they are useless at the moment.<br />

Since you&#039;re here, may I ask you something else related to the loadout screen? Would it be possible to implement the featurues I describe in this post? <div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com/en/board/topic/112806/1/ALL-attachments-upgrades-visible-in-general-Loadout-view</div>            </div>
