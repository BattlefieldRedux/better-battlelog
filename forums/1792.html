                A simple plugin that turns the premium look for battlelog (the logo and background) off so it looks like it did before you bought premium (which I personally prefer)<br />
<br />
You can get it here: <div class="inline post-url">http://websiteofandrew.com/static/bf3/non-premium.js</div><br />
just add that url to your plugin and close and restart battle log and it should work.            </div>

                As for 08/29/2012, the site in which the code was hosted seems to be down. I would really like the code to be made available again through another one, if possible, because I find this plugin really useful.            </div>
