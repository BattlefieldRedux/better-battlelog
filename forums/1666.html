                Greetings.<br />
<br />
I have recently started using BBlog after trying a few other Userscripts and add-ons, and I must say, it&#039;s an impressive piece of kit. It does almost everything the others do, and better in many cases. However I find myself missing one thing. The userscript &quot;http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/125532&quot; added a max ping filter to the server filter. I personally found this very useful and I would like to see it in BBlog. Then, I would only need one add-on for all my Battlelog needs.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve searched through the forum and haven&#039;t found mention of it, so if it&#039;s been asked before I apologise. Thanks to all the developers, and keep up the good work!<br />

I know that Userscript but it requires to do more requests than usually - Thats the reason why i not implement this. Also ping various every second, it makes not much sense to enable a filter for this.<br />
