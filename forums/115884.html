                I love the server preset buttons, but it&#039;s annoying to have to minimize the server filter options huge menu every time. It&#039;d be cool if the thing would minimize itself after clicking a server filter button.<br />
<br />
Picture examples of what I&#039;m talking about:<br />
<br />
Every time I click one of my server filter preset buttons I have to either scroll past or quickly minimize this large options menu after the page reloads: <div class="inline post-url">http://i.imgur.com/jK8zwIs.jpg</div><br />
<br />
It&#039;d be cool if instead of having to click this &quot; ^ &quot; it just begins minimized: <div class="inline post-url">http://i.imgur.com/jzEUSkM.jpg</div><br />
<br />
So that way I can click one of my presets and blam - minimal scrolling effort to quickly find a server, looks like this instead after clicking a preset, as opposed to the first screenshot being the reloaded page&#039;s results : <div class="inline post-url">http://i.imgur.com/rdHXFUu.jpg</div><br />
<br />
Anyway excellent sexy add-on thanks BBLog dudes! (I&#039;m using Firefox 27.0.1)            </div>

                Battlelog itself should save your last state - If it&#039;s opened or closed.<br />
So, if you close it once, you can toggle your presets easily without the need of minimize it again and again.<br />
<br />
For me it work like so, in all supported browsers.            </div>

                I guess it seems to save the state of it being minimized or not at the time of creating the preset filter. Thank you for the info BrainFooLong :) I&#039;ll just remake them for Firefox and save them with it minimized, it seems to stay minimized after each button click after that. Any time I use my preset buttons that I had saved with it expanded no matter how many times I minimize it, each use of the preset button loads back to the saved state of it being expanded again. Mystery solved yay!<br />
<br />
update: I recreated them all real quick making sure to save them with that filter options window minimized and now they all stay minimized, so that worked.            </div>

                Yes its saved with your preset if it&#039;s expanded or not.<br />
That&#039;s not a fine thing and i will fix this, that the preset not override the expand status anymore - Than it should be work as expected.            </div>
