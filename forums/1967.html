                First of all, I want to get it out of the way - love the idea of the user-created assignments. Gives players a little extra to work towards, and I like how they&#039;ve been implemented. I do have a few suggestions that may make them even better!<br />
<br />
1. I know this probably isn&#039;t possible, but is there any way to work with DICE to make the assignments worth XP or some other small reward to give players a little more incentive to actually complete the assignments and want to pay attention to them? As they are a few of them seem like endless grinds just to say you&#039;ve completed them. Not all players may enjoy that.<br />
<br />
2. Maybe implement a feature that allows players to create their own assignments on BBlog and challenge their friends to complete them. The challenged player could either accept or decline the challenge and have a certain time frame to complete (Nothing too impossible, so it would still be fun, yet challenging). If the person who accepted the assignment completed it, maybe there could be a way for that assignment to show up and stay on the assignments page? (Perhaps under a &quot;Custom Assignment&quot; header?)<br />
<br />
3. It would be nice if there was an option to hide/show the BBlob assignments on the main assignment page as to not get them mixed up with the actual in game ones.<br />
<br />
Any input or suggestions for my ideas would be greatly appreciated, and once again, really enjoying the addition of this feature to BBlog!            </div>

Its not so easy to create this calculation for assigments. and it would take to much time to create a interface wich working good, where you can select the rules.<br />
<br />
i think brain won&#039;t include a feature like this.<br />
<br />
we have a lot of other ideas for assigments, you see atm 8 of them, so wait a little bit, maybe we will release a assigments wich you wanted to create, than you have done the work for nothing.  just keep the eyes open ;-)            </div>

                1. Impossible, only DICE can give you In-Game Rewards.<br />
<br />
2. Idea is good but the work for it... Don&#039;t want to think about it...<br />
It is nearly impossible to create a system that every user easily can create assignments.<br />
Also our server will absolutely crash and i definetily don&#039;t want buy more servers, the one that exist comes from my private money, every month.<br />
<br />
3. As juress say, a minimize button already integrated.            </div>

                Hello, is it possible to store this custom assignment in local?<br />
For exemple, create a module with checkboxes where we can chose witch options we want for an assignment, and save it in a custom *.js on the computer.<br />
Create some standard images, and use them to this custom assignment, in fonction of which options are selected.<br />
<br />
This *.js can be upload on your server via the BBlog user cloud for use on different computers (I&#039;m using my personnal computer and the one I&#039;ve at my work), but it&#039;s not an obligation :)<br />
<br />
This is for personnal use, and we can&#039;t share this, but I think this is a good game experience.            </div>
