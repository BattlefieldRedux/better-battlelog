                My clan used to do these every once in a while. We would set a date and plan to get on that time to do something that we don&#039;t normally get to do. Would anyone like to do something similar with a bf2 mod. I never really got the chance to play around with too many of them.<br />
If you don&#039;t have BF2 installed anymore, try and add it to your Origin library. When you download it from there it will come fully patched and ready to go.<br />
Here is a mod site to look around: <div class="inline post-url">http://www.moddb.com/mods?filter=t&amp;kw=Search+...&amp;released=&amp;style=def&amp;theme=&amp;game=109&amp;type=</div><br />
I just installed Omnicide and that is a fun zombie mod.            </div>
