                Hello Better Battlelog Team!<br />
<br />
Thank you for making such a good extension - it transformed Battlelog into something useful :)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m currently in the process of service starring all weapons on BF4, and I was wondering if you could update the filters available on the Stats &gt; Weapons page?<br />
<br />
Currently, unless you either select the &quot;All&quot; filter or search directly, launchers like the RPG/SMAW don&#039;t exist in any of the current filters.<br />
<br />
As far as I am aware, this excludes:<br />
<br />
<br />
All M320 variants (3GL, FB, Smoke, Dart, LVG, HE)<br />
<br />
The Ballistic Shield<br />
<br />
All engineer launched weapons RPG, SMAW, Stinger, Igla, LAW, SRAW, Javelin<br />
<br />
Defibrillator<br />
<br />
Repair Tool<br />
<br />
Battlepickups HVM-II, M136-CS, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Could you add some new filters and extend some current ones?<br />
<br />
Gadgets (extend to include - Defibrillator, Repair Tool, Ballistic Shield)<br />
<br />
Launchers (new filter to include all Engineer portable launchers)<br />
<br />
Underslung (new filter to include all underslung variants M26/M320)<br />
<br />
*Battle Pickups (new filter to include all battlepickups - M32 MGL, HVM-II, M136-CS, AMR-2 all variants, M2A83 all variants, Rorsch)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it is possible, then can I also suggest removing the current Battle Pickup snipers/shotguns from their respective current filters too?<br />
<br />
<br />

                Sorry for late response.<br />
The filters are taken directly from the battlelog weapon groups, we just make it available for filter.<br />
If they don&#039;t have those things properly included than it&#039;s a pain, but we can&#039;t fix this unless we rewrite the whole filter system, which we will not do.            </div>
