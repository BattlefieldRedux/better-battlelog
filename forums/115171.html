                Also this must be said several times.<br />
<br />
I, Roland aka BrainFooLong, the Admin and Developer of BBLog, want to say THANK YOU.<br />
<br />
Thank you to the whole BBLog Team for your help, feedback, suggestions, ideas. You are great, you are awesome.<br />
<br />
Thank you to the whole BBLog Team for your help, feedback, suggestions, ideas. Without a community like you BBLog would not be the same. You are that what a developer want from a community - Constructive, helpful and cool ideas. You not flame here, you&#039;re friendly, your smart, that show us that we do a good job.<br />
<br />
BBLog exist since start of BF3 and we still here, and we still grow, and we still improve things.<br />
There was hard times, hard decisions,hard work and many headaches.<br />
4 Million Downloads/Updates - Epic for a project that started with 1000 Downloads in the first stable version V1.0.<br />
<br />
I try to keep that project alive and running as long as possible - At the moment it looks like that we have many many years to go. Let us see what the future brings, BF5? BFBC3? StarsWars in Battlelog?            </div>

                Oh, and another thing that i&#039;ve forgotten.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all donaters - Each donation help me a lot.<br />
To be honest, all donations summed up does not reach the costs the i have.<br />
But hey, it doesn&#039;t matter - Even if it&#039;s just 1% of my costs, i&#039;m thankful for everything.            </div>

                Maybe it was a little more but at max. 1500.<br />
It wasnt that big on the first public release. If your read the changelog you will see it doesn&#039;t had a lot features.            </div>
