^ Theres the image i want the emblem to look like, no need for the background, if you could make it premiun free friendly that would be amazing. So only 20 layers :D            </div>

                So, I was a little bored and I threw this together really quick.  It&#039;s not perfect yet, or exact but it&#039;s close to the image you provided.  It needs a little touch up and maybe a little adjustment on the centering, but it&#039;s something for you to work with.  Currently it only has 11 layers, so it&#039;s non-Premium friendly.  If/when I get some time, perhaps I&#039;ll put a little more work into it to get it perfect.  <br />
<br />
Let me know if it&#039;s missing anything, or if you have any problems with it.  <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the emblem code.<br />
<br />
Edit - Hmm, I tried posting the code, but the forum cut parts of the text out.  If you&#039;d like, just look me up on Battlelog and copy it yourself.  I&#039;ll keep it in my emblem collection for now if you decide you&#039;d like to use it.  <br />
<br />
My Battlelog name is the same as here:  JesusChrist454<br />
<br />
If you have any other suggestions on how I can post the emblem code then let me know, thanks.  <br />
<br />
Edit -#2  I also just noticed that the emblem won&#039;t work if you don&#039;t have the right angle triangle unlocked.  It&#039;s one of the battlepack emblems, not a premium emblem shape.  If you don&#039;t have it unlocked, let me know and I&#039;ll try to make something else work in its place (you can probably just use strokes in place of the triangle if necessary.            </div>
