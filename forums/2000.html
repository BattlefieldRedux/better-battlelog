                Hello people,<br />
<br />
for a day, I use BBLOg because I had never before considered that you can make it so great.<br />
<br />
With all the great extensions that you have entered I lack but one:<br />
<br />
Could youinstall a Teamspeak button, which exists only then TeamSpeak is installed, so that you can start the TeamSpeak from the browser and dont get back to desktop.<br />
<br />

                Sorry this isn&#039;t possible.<br />
Addon&#039;s cannot check which software is installed, and that is very good so.<br />
Don&#039;t want to think about the case that every addon can spy my whole computer for software.            </div>

For what would you need a TS3 Button?<br />
<br />
The Link ts3server://getbblog.com?port=10000 does exactly what you want.<br />
if you have installed TS3, the Browser will automaticly notice, that the <div class="tag tag-u">ts3server://</div> is a TS3 protocoll and will automaticly open TS3 and connect to this Server.<br />
<br />
If somebody doesn&#039;t have installed TS3, the browser don&#039;t know what to do and nothing will happens, so no problem. dont care about this ^^            </div>

                Ok,<br />
<br />
Software compatibility is one thing I understand, too.<br />
<br />
But would it not be possible to just install a button like yours, which can be determined by the users themselves, to go to their own server.            </div>

                We want to give our users the possibility, to connect to our Teamspeak Server and can request Support by Teamspeak or just to talk with us about the addon.<br />
<br />
if you want to add a Link to your own Teamspeak Server, you can write an own plugin or us this here: <div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=566</div><br />
<br />
there you can add the adress to your own TS Server and you have your Link (not button)            </div>
