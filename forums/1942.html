                The idea of showing the assignments tabs after a round are a good idea dont get me wrong.<br />
Yet for people who are focussing on the ones they havent completed they have to go through all the assignments completed or not. <br />
Would it not be more efficient if only the uncompleted assignments show in game after a round?<br />
I have mentioned this to my fellow players on TS and they also think this is a good idea because like me once you complete an assignment in game you no longer need to see it.            </div>

                I think you mean the after round in-game assignments showing - for that you have to write DICE, we&#039;re only making the Battlelog better.            </div>

                YOU SEE only the Assignments, on wich you have worked during the round. and then you get at the end the &quot;message&quot; that its completed.<br />
<br />
i think thats exactly how it should be. and: Juress already said everything.            </div>
