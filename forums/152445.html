                What can we make out of this image? Well to start off I almost played 337 hours of this game, secondly I&rsquo;m not too bad.<br />
Now what was this post about again? Well it&#039;s about a major bug spanning the entire universe as we know it. You&rsquo;re probably sitting there asking yourself what bug is this guy with a kill death ratio of 1.021 talking about.<br />
Well if you would let me explain without interrupting me every sentence I could exactly show you this major bug.<br />
If you look closely to my current stats you will see the following:<br />
Score Top = 17.17%<br />
Score per minute = 871.64<br />
Kill / Deaths ratio = 1.021<br />
Headhot / Kill % = 15.60%<br />
First off you can see that I&rsquo;m pretty good but when you read it out loud you might notice that you are capitalizing top while it&#039;s not the first word in the sentence nor does it comply with any other valid reason of capitalization.<br />
The score per minute is fine. But then you get Kill / Deaths ratio should read Kill / Death ratio, Kill / death ratio, Kill-death ratio or KDR but not Kill / Deaths ratio that&#039;s just wrong by google standards.<br />
Next up Headhot / Kill % this is actually why I wanted to report a bug but after reading more carefully the other ones were also pretty bad I mean did you even read it carefully Headhot / Kill % that&#039;s it I&rsquo;m taking a break.<br />
 <br />
^That there is a shit posting ranting about free software I didn&#039;t even pay for complaining about minor grammar mistakes but the grammar Nazis never give they never surrender.            </div>

                I&#039;m astonished. I don&#039;t even understand what you are talking about, seriously.<br />
I just tried to read it a few times - Syntax error in my head.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure if you are making a joke, a satire, or a troll post.<br />
Anyway, if i take it serious and when i search in the whole code of BBLog i cannot find the &quot;headhot&quot; spell anywhere. So, crazy as i am, i move this to another sub-forum because i am 66% (+/- 6%) sure that this post is not related to BBLog.            </div>

                Since when 1.03 KD is good?<br />
You are not good, you just are not bad :P.<br />
Your head-shot ratio is good 2000/12000 but its not a good meter to evaluate a player because it can be higher for players that play maps with no vehicles. (and your vehicles kills do support my point)<br />
<br />
In order not to search here is his profile:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/soldier/L1v1ngdeadsouls/stats/356133769/pc/</div><br />
<br />
PS: I still can understand where the bug is. Are you on the right forum?<br />
<br />
= My stats<br />
Kills = 24,279<br />
Vehicles Kills = 3,742 + 2,511 + 2,289 + 684 + 603 + 573 + 318 + 229 + 208 + 81 + 62 + 45 + 41 + 38 = 11,424<br />
No vehicles kills = 12855<br />
Headshots = 2681<br />
<br />
= Your stats<br />
Kills = 12,846<br />
Vehicles Kills = 155 + 74 + 66 + 57 + 46 + 31 + 30 + 15 + 13 + 10 + 1 = 498<br />
No vehicles kills = 12348<br />
Headshots = 2,000<br />
<br />
See my point?<br />
<br />
** EDIT **<br />
<br />
I think I found out what he is talking about...<br />
Under the player profile the<br />
&quot;Extended Player Statistics - Powered by bf4stats.com&quot;<br />
Score Top = 13.70%<br />
Score per minute = 867.52<br />
Kill / Deaths ratio = 1.031<br />
Headhot / Kill % = 15.75%<br />
<br />
But what is your problem?            </div>
