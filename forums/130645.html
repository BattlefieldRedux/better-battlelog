                Its been a while since I have been here, but I like the new in browser text editor and new plugin flow :)  (init, domchange, cache functions, etc...at least I don&#039;t remember them if they were there before lol). One of the things I did before when I first started up a project was to copy-paste from a file that I had that had pretty much nothing on it but what was needed to have a plugin running (handle, domchange, translations, etc). It would be nice to have a button to press that auto types all that for you. No comments or anything, just the skeleton code.<br />
<br />
Also, as a side thing, some kind of API reference would be cool. Not sure how much has been added, or how much there would be to reference too, but would be cool.            </div>

                A little late but...<br />
<br />
I think the &quot;Quick Setup&quot; is the example plugin.<br />
The first starting point is always the example plugin - If you are an advanced plugin dev you will probably already have your own skeleton file :)<br />
<br />
To provide an empty file with only basic code with no comments is only for extended devs - And extended devs simple can make their own skeleton file :)            </div>
