                I love the feature of embedding youtube links so they play directly on the Battlelog, but why not for vimeo.com as well ?<br />
<br />
I put my videos on vimeo, but everyone has to click the link :-(<br />
<br />
Thank you very much            </div>

Are you still interested in this plugin? (Or someone else)<br />
I would do such plugin for you. Just give me a signal that you still want it :)            </div>

it still requires that the users have installed BBLog ;-)<br />
the reason why not yet supported has to do with the popularity of vimeo.<br />
