                Hello :)<br />
<br />
I was thinking about a feature that could be nice. Imagine you want to play on your favourite server 1500 tickets, but you see that there is only 300-400 tickets to a team. So, you plan to wait the next round. My idea was to create a sort of timer or an auto-connect which will advise us that the actual round is finished and that you can now join for the next round.<br />
<br />
So, you won&#039;t miss the start of the next round... <br />
<br />
I hope you understand.<br />
Maybe it is a bad idea, maybe not. I just wanted to share it to you while I thought to it.            </div>

                I love the idea, but you might have more luck asking for this feature in Battlelog+ (http://battlelogplus.com/) as it&#039;s more in line with the features of their extended scoreboard.            </div>

                The Idea sounds cool but the scripting for this things is very complicated.<br />
the full serverbrowser from dice cant be analysed or modified so easily.<br />

Battlelog+ is not an nice Addon, you HAVE to register you in their Forum, thats the Reason, why the Battlelog+ Thread in the German Forum was closed. EA Moderators and DICE Member doesn&#039;t like Addons where you can link a used Addon to a registred Member on an external Board or if you have to regist yourself on an external Side to can use the Addon.            </div>

<br />
You don&#039;t really HAVE to register for battlelog+ you only need to if you want to leave server comments/vote on comments, everything else doesn&#039;t require a account<br />
<br />
This is to keep people from abusing this feature            </div>

                Ok, never mind. That was just a &quot;good optional feature&quot;, but not very necessary.            </div>
