                I guess that will be a game that i will play a long time.<br />
Map Editor (Oh my god, it&#039;s unique since many years), fantastic graphics, sandboxed, maybe good multiplayer - All that things i want from a game.<br />
<br />
Anyone else will play this?            </div>

                Will be getting it for sure, I loved the map editor in FC2. I just made maps for fun, didn&#039;t even publish them. Was pretty good maps though.            </div>

                So, I got it and it&#039;s really fun so far :)<br />
<br />
Though you require Uplay installed to launch the game (on PC retail copies, not on Steam copies), it&#039;s not really a big deal, at least it&#039;s better than Origin, it has more useful stuff.<br />
Feel free to add me on Uplay, my name is CocaRola. Just one of my many online personas :)            </div>

                Well, finished the Singleplayer.<br />
Very cool, good story, good gameplay.<br />
Very sexy ending when you choose the &quot;bad&quot; side :-)            </div>

                I haven&#039;t even been on half of the map yet. I&#039;ve been doing all side missions and that kind of stuff, also having some fun trying to craft all stuff.<br />
<br />
Do you know how to get the required stuff to craft the extended stuff? It says the required stuff to craft them can be found on a side mission, the animal hunting things. I&#039;ve yet to understand how and when to find them.            </div>

                Nope, i don&#039;t have found any of the special requirements for the latest crafts.<br />
But i don&#039;t have done many side missions atm.            </div>

                It&#039;s flippin&#039; brilliant...<br />
<br />
Open world, awesome story. I feel like they took some components from Assassins Creed - the radio towers for instance, but i like it.<br />
The only thing I&#039;am missing is playing the full story with a friend in coop, that would be even more amazing. I know there is some kind of COOP but I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s very linear.<br />
<br />
The AI is a bit unfinished, enemy knows where you are even if they haven&#039;t had a chance to spot you and instead of scaning the perimiter, they are going for you directly. I really like the pirate camp diversity, each is somehow different, you can set animals free to murder the entire camp for you (I let a bear free from it&#039;s cage and it just obliterated the entire camp :D), the alarms are pain you have to take care of, brilliant.<br />
<br />
All in all, I love it and the driving model from FC2 is the highlight of the game (next to the naked Citra :D)<br />
<br />
This game came couple of days after Assassins Creed 3 and even tho I&#039;am a big fan of AC series, I like FC3 more.<br />
<br />
I am somewhere half way through (I am doing all the missions, side missions, camps, towers and hunting missions) and still having fun.<br />
<br />
One bug, dunno if you have it too - I&#039;ve got a levitating bow stuck somehow to my body, every time I look down on the ground, it&#039;s there and I cant get rid of it :D            </div>

The &quot;good&quot; end is the typical theatrical happy end.<br />
The &quot;bad&quot; is that what i expected, except the thingy with the knife :-)<br />

Well, one of the best SP i played in the last years.            </div>

                I don&#039;t really see Far Cry as a multiplayer game, never played it in FC2. If you&#039;ve tried multiplayer in FC3, can you tell me if it&#039;s worth while?            </div>
