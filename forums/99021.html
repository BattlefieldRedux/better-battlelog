                Hmm, InfinityWard made a massive step forward to come even with DICE. Their new game, Call of Duty: Ghosts, is with it&#039;s new engine a better looking game. The trailer somehow gives me goosebumps.. The time when I was addicted to Call of Duty is over, but this reminds me of the game it supposed to be. An award winning game with loads of good gameplay. <div class="inline font-size-50">Just for the record, I played Modern Warfare 1 and 2.</div><br />
<br />
Back to Call of Duty: Ghosts. One thing for sure, InfinityWard have made bigger improvements with Ghosts, than DICE did with BF4. Here&#039;s the trailer. <br />

                If &quot;new engine&quot; means &quot;new generation od the same fucking engine they&#039;ve been using for 10 years (quake 3 engine), then yea, I guess.<br />
One thing I like about CoD:G - LEAN! <br />
<br />
FFs COD is an arcade game and they added this tactical feature. Why can&#039;t DICE implement it?<br />
<br />
Anyways - graphic on BC2-BF3 level, nothing new.            </div>

                Pre-rendered trailers are always nice looking. But without actual game play being shown, nothing is known for sure.<br />

                Everyone thought that after MW2, Black ops will have got such great graphics. After black ops, though much people thought hat MW3 will have &gt;&gt; the &lt;&lt; new great graphics experience. And this repeated again and again &#039;til black ops 2.<br />

<br />
Wow, it&#039;s so hard to improve Black Ops 2 with his great graphix.<br />
Anyway, at the Xbox one event, Activision talked about &quot;dynamic experiences&quot;. Huh, sounds like Frostbite destruction? I remember that they&#039;ve said at the release of MW3 or BO2, that destruction doesn&#039;t work with the &quot;typical&quot; gameplay of CoD. Fuckin copycats. They realized that battlefield took CoD doggy.            </div>

Free dedicated server soft is the only thing CoD series did right, anyone can host a server. With BF you actually need to pay monthly, which for me is retarded and I&#039;m astonished that there are actual people that are willing to pay fees monthly from their own pockets to host a server, srsly...<br />
Server finding thingy? Whats battlelog then? What about preBF3? Same thing.            </div>

                I don&#039;t mean with &quot;server host&quot; thingy the server browser list in BF or the server list in COD.<br />
But in the last COD&#039;s you didn&#039;t had any of that. You just get randomly assigned to a match, the is hosted by a user itself (anyone is randomly the host). You don&#039;t have the choice on which &quot;host&quot; you can join.<br />
That i mean with the crap system.<br />
<br />
Dedicated server that a player can open/host is the best what a multiplayer can have. That was the best in the &quot;old school&quot; shooters. Now everybody try to make money from the cow (the community).<br />
<br />
Now is COD Ghosts it seems like that Dedicated Server come back.            </div>

                Buy? i dont think so, well, i won&#039;t buy BF4 neither due to actual rig limitations (it&#039;s not much enjoyable in my machine but it&#039;s barely playable.), in fact, i feel like this:<br />
<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://i.imgur.com/hSC6wCF.gif</div><br />
<br />
If for some reason someone gifts COD to me i will play it, I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s worst than BF4, i&#039;m pretty sure my rig will be capable of handle this, and that&#039;s more than enough for me to play it, also if i can create a server like in other games (with a software) i may use the dedicated remote server i have access to<div class="tag tag-b"> only</div> host scrims and play without lag. <br />
<br />
the dedicated server is part of the game server our clan sponsor has, if not, i would donate it for BBLog stuff. Only I and our sponsor have access to it due to the fact i do some work for them, maybe i&#039;ll get some pay in the future, not much, but for me every penny is worth it. :D.<br />
