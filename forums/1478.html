                In game bf3 has progress bars for each vehicle after you&#039;ve gotten the first service star, it would be nice to see how close I am to getting my next service stars for vehicles while on battlelog.            </div>

                i want to re-open this topic.<br />
i think/hope that with bf3stats it could be possible to integrate the Vehicle Service Stars by bf3stats.com (like the Top X% by each vehicle and weapon).<br />
<br />
i have made a picture how it could look:<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://temp.elchalarm.net/bblog-vehicle-servstar.jpg</div><br />
<br />
The Text (&quot;Fahrz.&quot;) next to &quot;Service Stars&quot; have to be replaced with &quot;Classes&quot; and &quot;Vehicles&quot;, so you can change between Class-Service Stars and Vehicle Service Stars.<br />
<br />
if we go with the mouse over the service stars we will get the black bubble like now with information how many % of the next Service Star we allready have.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
an other point:<br />
Could you reorganize the the buttons on the vehicle page?<br />
currently they are organized like this:<br />
<br />
AHA - AJA - AHS - AJF - MBT - AAV - IFV - VT - WSAA - WSAT - All<br />
<br />
It would be better to organize / show them by Classes as by the Service Star. That means:<br />
AHS - IFV - AHA - MTB - AAV - AJF - VT - WSAA - WSAT - All<br />
<br />
in detail i mean, there are no differents between &quot;Air Jet Attack&quot; and &quot;Air Jet Fighter&quot;.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Other point: you&#039;re writing &quot;VT&quot; and in the descripttion (bubble) its written &quot;Transport Vehicle&quot;. shouldn&#039;t it be &quot;TV&quot; or &quot;Vehicle Transport&quot;?<br />
<br />
Last Point: what does &quot;WSAA&quot; and &quot;WSAT&quot; mean? &quot;W??? Stationary Anti Air&quot; and &quot;W??? Stationary Anti Transport&quot;? Shoulnd&#039;t be written &quot;WSAV&quot; for &quot;W??? Stationary Anti Vehicle&quot;?<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
only a few points. the last section (with WSA...) is not so important... i have just thought a little bit about these words.            </div>

                The top post says about EACH vehicle, you talk about the vehicle groups (which is possible).<br />
<br />
1. VH Stars - Possible, but need to check the Battlelog things. A request to bf3stats at this page doubles the request to bf3stats at this page - And this could have huge load impacts to bf3stats servers.<br />
2. No - A regroup isn&#039;t necessary - It&#039;s better just for you and it is no real improvement.<br />
3. All names of groups are taken directly by battlelogs internal names. So i do not change the names because this are the official descriptions.            </div>

its not have to do with my personal point of view. its have to do with the order on the right side (Vehicle gadgets).<br />
<br />
They are organized in the way like i show, AHS - IFV - AHA - MTB - AAV - AJF. i&#039;ve order the icons on my picture in the same order and think in the navigation should it be the same. only to have the same order like by the gadgets.<br />
<br />

ohh there are internal names for these groups?! oO dont know that. howsoever, the different between AJA and AJF doesn&#039;t exist.            </div>

                Vehicle Service Stars implemented in next version (on vehicle list page).<br />
Other stuff need more checks.            </div>
