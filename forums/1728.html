* Even more programmer skills in every section.<br />

                Hi, I am interested in contributing.  I certainly meet all your criteria and get the whole &quot;its free&quot; thing.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;m just a Software Engineer who&#039;s gotten to a point in my job where I am not doing much coding, but still thoroughly enjoy doing it when I can.  I am a BF3 lover and have even messed around a little with a small project of my own.  If you&#039;d care to check it out its at: <div class="inline post-url">http://bf3battlereports.appspot.com</div>  Its pretty buggy right now and doesn&#039;t quite look like they way I want but I think its not a bad start.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty impressed w/ what you&#039;ve done and would appreciate helping out.            </div>
