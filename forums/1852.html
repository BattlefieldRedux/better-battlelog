                Hi.<br />
<br />
As you may know, if you have a custom filter active like &quot;FF on&quot; and the &quot;Normal&quot; preset, you won&#039;t get any results.<br />
<br />
While this may be obvious for experienced players, it&#039;s not for your average Joe. So what i&#039;m asking is simply: if you have any sort of custom filters active, de-select any presets.            </div>
        </div>

                What you mean with custom filters?<br />
If you mean that is commonly a battlelog problem you should goto EA/DICE with this issue.            </div>

                I did actually: <div class="inline post-url">https://getsatisfaction.com/battlefield3/topics/server_browser_filter_and_custom_servers_not_working_right_not_displaying_custom_servers</div><br />
<br />
They think it&#039;s not a problem, people just shouldn&#039;t be stupid. -.-<br />
<br />
To clarify: On the server browser there&#039;s the &quot;Advanced settings&quot; area which let&#039;s you set various custom filters.<br />
<br />
The problem is, that if any of those adv. filters are active and you happen to have a preset (normal, hardcore, inf-only) activated, too, you won&#039;t find any servers at all.<br />
<br />
Some people - including me - think that this isn&#039;t obvious enough. That&#039;s why i&#039;m proposing it here: if &quot;Filters&quot; is checked under &quot;Advanced settings&quot;, automatically de-select all of the &quot;Presets&quot;.            </div>

Agreed, but they don&#039;t think it&#039;s a problem, which in turn makes it an even bigger one. Did you even read that thread? There&#039;s an employee deeming it &quot;not a problem&quot;.<br />
<br />
You Addon is pretty popular (i&#039;m even thinking of porting it to Opera), which is why fixing it here would already help a lot of people and create a &quot;better Battlelog&quot;, wouldn&#039;t it?            </div>

                You are right, and i don&#039;t readed the getsatisfaction thread yet.<br />
I&#039;m currently blocking many &quot;minor&quot; requests because my time is very limited ATM.<br />
But i keep it in mind and do some quick tests about this. If it is a work of 5 minutes it should be in next update.            </div>
