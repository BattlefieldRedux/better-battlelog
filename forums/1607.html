                It would be really cool to have a field where you could enter a comment about people on your friends list. I tend to friend people after playing a good round with (or against) them, but then later I forget who they were or why they were added to my list (IE. were they kicking ass in the jet, PTFO-ing like crazy, being great at ressing etc). Just a small field to add a comment that would be stored as a cookie or similar would be cool.            </div>
