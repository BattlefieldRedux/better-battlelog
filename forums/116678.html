                I found a game engine that is pretty nice and can use a JavaScript-esque language. I figured since a lot of people on here know JavaScript and like games, you might be interested in it...and its free. :D<br />

                Let me ask a question... which is better? To develop with a game engine or with out? Coz i really want to build everything alone but.. takes time and u may meshup eveything. I mean, game engines do provide some stuct on your main project. Whats your opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.            </div>

                I am also a type of &quot;Do it yourself&quot; but at these days there is no real alternative than using a game engine.<br />
If you are a superpro in hardcore coding and you can make your own game engine, than you don&#039;t have to ask that question. But in normal case, you have to use an existing game engine.<br />
<br />
I recommend Unity for a few reasons, i tested a lot others also.<br />
<br />
* Easy to learn<br />
* Powerful for advanced users - Graphic Quality can be compared with Top other game engines<br />
* Cross Game Engine - Single Develop, all Platform<br />
* FREE - Also when you sell a game - Until you have a yearly income of 100.000 USD (license agreements)<br />
* Pro version for cheap money - about 70&euro; per month for an engine<br />
* Both 2D and 3D native support<br />
* Constantly growing community<br />
* Tons of tutorials and help in the Net            </div>

                Thanks for your answer. I think you are right, some thinks are bettter to use them prebuild as someone else did the work your you, especialy if you are not in a big team.<br />
