                So,<br />
<br />
for me, personally, this battlefield will be skipped.<br />
<br />
What i don&#039;t like is...<br />
... the counterstrike play style - All what i&#039;ve loved in BF is gone in BF Hardline. They not should call it battlefield because the only thing that is the same is the underlying engine, frostbite.<br />
... for me it feels like a downgrade - graphics are worse, all feels technically not so good as in BF<br />
... if i don&#039;t mind about the above to points, why i should buy this game? For me it doesn&#039;t have an reliable improvement from BF3/BF4 to BFH. It&#039;s just another 7/10 game in the already supersaturated shooter genre.<br />
<br />
BF3 was a revolution<br />
BF4 was a evolution<br />
BFH ???<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts, what&#039;s yours?<br />
<br />
Fortunetely i don&#039;t have to buy this game to make BBLog work in BFH :)            </div>

                So far I&#039;m enjoying most of my time spent with the Beta, but I agree with your points, especially the third one. It doesn&#039;t feel like a polished AAA game, it&#039;s more like a (high quality) mod for BF4 and shouldn&#039;t be priced like a full game.<br />
<br />
Definitely not gonna buy it, even if it&#039;s on sale (most likely will be dead at that point).            </div>

                I don&#039;t think is BFH is a Battlefield game. Maybe is a good game, but isn&#039;t Battlefield.<br />
Visceral/EA/DICE are using the name to sell, obvious.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like the Beta (Closed, because this Open is a trial demo, IMO). I&#039;m not going to buy until a good promotion sale (50%, maybe?), this game not worth full price unfortunately.<br />
<br />
See, this isn&#039;t a crap game, but isn&#039;t a Battlefield.            </div>

                I agree that this is nothing but a high quality mod for BF4 and should be sold for lower price.. <br />
But then again, i&#039;ve been playing the beta and must say i enjoy it. It may have potential to be a success, maybe. <br />
<br />
BF3/4 did became better and better if u compare them with the Beta&#039;s and first release. <br />
<br />
I admit im a pre-order BF fan, cause i like to show my support, even if they make a shitty game sometimes. <br />
Like my local football team, i support them even when they loose and play like sh*t :-) <br />
<br />
The graphic can be better and hopefully the game will update  to the high quality standard we know from BF4. <br />
