                Hey guys, i have these ideas on my head since some time so I&#039;m gonna share it with you.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Thread Rating System:</div><br />
If you use BBLOG you should be able to give 1-5 Stars for a Thread.<br />
<br />
This way we can avoid false leading titles or just bad trolling posts<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Hooah! to Stats:</div><br />
If we can give Hoaah to Forum Posts/Achievements why not give Hooah to<br />
Weapon stats, KD/R, W/L, SPM etc.<br />
<br />
If i see a crazy stat I would give it a Hooah!<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">View Counter for Profile Page:</div><br />
Not sure if this is possible but a view counter on how many people viewed your Profile would be nice.<br />
only thing 1 could add is &quot;Flag Counter&quot; but not sure if its working correctly.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is possible in your hands or not.            </div>
        </div>

                Hi,<br />
<br />
those are generaly very nice ideas and I&#039;d like to see them implemented as well, but I&#039;d say that this would be pretty heavy on the database and I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s fine with Brain.<br />
<br />
Well, wait for his definitive opinion :)            </div>

                So, thanks for your ideas, my feedback...<br />
<br />
1. Already thought about but it requires too much server load for our small server. No way to get this without breaking our server.<br />
2. Same.<br />
3. Same and the counter will never show a correct result because it will be counted only for BBLog people that visiting your page. Maybe you can use a workaround like embedding a counter image into your profile description from any tracking service out there. All BBLog people will automatically see the image (if option is enabled) and this results in a count.            </div>
