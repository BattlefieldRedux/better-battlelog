                Dont mind the background and the colors of it.<br />
<br />
I would like the 6 panels under &quot;Top Story&quot; on battlelog page to become 3 panels in the following order, but first, is that even possible? anyhow, images under show what i&#039;d like to request:<br />
<br />
<div class="post-image-prepared inline">Stock panel layout</div><br />
<br />
<div class="post-image-prepared inline">Requested panel layout</div><br />
<br />
I think this could be used by others that find the leaderboard, premium and reccomended server box to be unnessesary use of space.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading :)            </div>

i think yes. easiest way would be to hide with CSS the boxes you dont want.<br />
i have no time and i&#039;m not intressted in plugin development. maybe anybody else?<br />
