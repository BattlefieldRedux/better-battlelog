Have you asked most of the users, since you already know that?<br />
<br />
The info about what server a player is playing on is already there, it&#039;s just about getting the info posted to facebook.<br />
<br />
That could be a part of your plugin, and i guess it isn&#039;t so much work.<br />
<br />
But, okay never mind, i&#039;ll find another way.            </div>

                I think that isn&#039;t helpful for most users because nobody before asked for any facebook integration in BBLog.            </div>

                I agree with brain. Unless we have more users that desire such a feature there isn&#039;t any need to implement it.<br />
All that would lead to is to make the BBLog plugin file size bigger and require less work to be done on other features. All that just to please some users.<br />
If you create a thread in the &quot;Custom Plugins&quot; forum section asking for this kind of feature you might get lucky and someone will create it for you.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying that this is a bad idea. All I&#039;m saying is that the demand for it at the moment as we see it is low.            </div>
