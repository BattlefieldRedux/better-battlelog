                This is mainly for research but also for fun :)<br />
<br />
1. How did you hear about BBLog for the first time?<br />
2. What is your favourite feature with BBLog.<br />
3a. What were your first thoughts about BBLog <div class="tag tag-b">before</div> you had installed it?<br />
3b. What were your first thoughts about BBLog <div class="tag tag-b">after</div> you had installed it?<br />
<br />

<br />
These are my answers:<br />
1. I first heard about BBLog on the Battlelog forums if I remember right.<br />
2. The favourite feature for me is the by far the support for Battlelog themes.<br />
3a. My first thought was that it sounded cool but I also had some suspicion if it was safe or not.<br />
3b. After I had tried it I thought that it was really cool, I also knew that it was safe by then.<br />
<br />
Fun fact: Some day after I had heard about it I got in contact with Roland and now I&#039;m here :P            </div>

                I heard about BBLog on a spanish community of Battlefield in a webpage called Taringa, the same day i got in contact with roland to be a translator because i want to improve my english with something.<br />
<br />
I mean, im not that good with english because all i know is thanks to MMORPGS and Linux (documentation and wikis).<br />
<br />
P.S: damn wrong topic, to many tabs isnt good.            </div>
