                We, BBLog, had in the past a feature for a buttton to remove a friend in the profile of this friend.<br />
We removed it in last release and today Battlelog natively integrated it, even if it&#039;s well hidden.<br />
<br />
When you click the report button on a friends profile you now have a option to remove the friend.<br />
<br />
Found it today now as i scrubbled the new code.            </div>
