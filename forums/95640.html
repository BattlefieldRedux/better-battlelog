                I thought a liddle bit and is it possible to make a plugin which creates a button on every players profile, which, when you click on it, make the player in your friendlist to see when he is playing.<br />
sounds wierd but i mean, when youtubers play you can see it (the most of them dont want randoms in their FL).<br />
like he start playing and plop in your FL so you can see: &quot;ahh, the yotuber is playing, i want to join&quot;<br />
only my idea and i really want to hear yyour opinions ^^            </div>

                I thought about this, as I&#039;m as well interested in such a plugin (Yes, I&#039;m able to create one). But my main issue now is how can I get the server where someone is playing? Is there any API for that? I&#039;m not into that and google did not give me any great results.<br />
I found a PHP API, but there is no information given about this topic. My work around would be reading the &quot;last seen&quot; servers and get the playerlist from every.. If the player is online in one of them it would work. I guess this is not the best method for that but I did not find anything else which I could load dynamically.            </div>

                I&#039;ll do.<br />
<br />
If the person is online (but not playing) you can see him, if the person is playing you can also see but also join him. Maybe I&#039;ll change the way it works, but at the moment it&#039;s fine for me.            </div>
