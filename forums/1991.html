                Hello,<br />
this idea actually comes from my wife and not from me :=)<br />
<br />
Wouldn&#039;t it be nice to have somewhere on the battlelog the total amount of the stars (kit, vehicles and weapons) you got?<br />
It would be also nice to have the stars counted separately: total amount of kit stars, total amount of vehicles stars and total amount of weapons stars.<br />
Then it would be nice, of course, to have a world list of players with stars. I think this &quot;competition&quot; would be interesting especially for the total amount of weapons stars.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention!<br />

                That might be interesting, but it would generate a lot of traffic on the battlelog servers, which is something Brain (the BBlog owner) is strongly against.            </div>

                Maybe we can make such thing as the BF3stats field. Only requested when you are on that specific page. :)            </div>

                This is a horrible thing to generate and keep up2date.<br />
It requires at least 4 requests to battlelog per player.<br />
A thing like this must be done by DICE (especially the world list thingy), only they could create performant queries on their servers.            </div>

                Ok thank you for your replies.<br />
I posted it on the Battlelog forum, for what it counts...            </div>
