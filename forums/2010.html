                I know that this is a DICE problem and not a BBLog problem, but would it be possible for any of you to fix it with the BBLog so that it can be listed alphabetically again?<br />
<br />
Thanks.            </div>

                We always wait some days/weeks after a battlelog update because DICE will change for sure something again, for example the weapon list with duplicated weapons.<br />
Was integrated 1 day, now it&#039;s not integrated anymore. I don&#039;t know why they added the duplicated weapons and i also don&#039;t know why they removed it one day later again :-)            </div>

                I don&#039;t bother or massacre DICE. They generally did a good job, with the game and battlelog. But there is some things that be funny and annoying, is in every game.            </div>
