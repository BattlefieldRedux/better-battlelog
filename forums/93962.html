                Kill and Death of soldiers and vehicles are displayed in profile together.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting if one of the K / D display both would separate.<br />
A kill and Death alone for the soldiers and one kill and death only for vehicles.<br />
<br />
I find the people who will always sit in a vehicle is not the true K / D shown correctly.<br />
<br />
Perhaps for the same accuracy<br />
<br />
Excuse my English<br />

                This is highly off topic, but seeing that the &quot;case is closed&quot; anyways, im going to go ahead. <br />
<br />
As i get more and more hours in to the game, I can see a lot of people thinking that &quot;all you do is sit on a tank, all you do is fly jet, come play the game for real&quot;. But that is the name of the game - Battlefield. As infantry we need to embrace the vehicles and stay the F out of their way unless we have some counter measures. There&#039;s no shame in playing the vehicles, vice versa, they are good assets. They are countered with good team play and filling the spots where your team is lacking. Now, if I only knew how to fly that chopper...<br />
<br />
Oh, and this is not to say you think this way, it&#039;s just something I have had in my mind for a while now as i learn the game, and this brought it to my mind again.<br />
<br />
Ps. But oh boy is that m320 a noob cannon or what ;)            </div>

M320 - yes it is :) just like noob tubing in MW1 and 2<br />
The only thing I have a problem with on the battlefield is a jet. Frking owerpowered nonsence. I understand that some jets are capable of destroying a tank in a matter of seconds, but this is a game, game needs to be balanced.            </div>

True, a good jet can change the outcome of the fight many times over - you have to counter with your own jet and anti air vehicles and stiglas whatchamacallits. But good grief it takes a TON of time to learn how to fly these machines. I&#039;ve spent 10 hours on a jet and I can&#039;t do jack schitt with them - needs plenty of swoops before I get a kill on a tank. And oh boy if I get a jet behind me... im a goner. They make it look so bloody easy while doing so too :D            </div>
