                Hi everybody,<br />
I just wanted to mention that the medal counter (how much ribbons need to be archived in order to get a medal) is screwed up. The Medals and Ribbons moved out of order, so that some counters count something else.<br />
My first Medal is Sniper - but the ribbon it is pointing to is the MCOM Defender Ribbon which has moved from its original location.<br />
That is the same for almost every medal there is ....            </div>

                BBLog 1.32 doesn&#039;t exist.<br />
Which browser do you use, also a screenshot would help us.            </div>

                Maybe try to deactive BBLog and check if the error still exist, if yes, it&#039;s a DICE problem.<br />
Also you should deactivate all user made bblog plugins if you use one.            </div>
