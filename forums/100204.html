                It&#039;s been out for a month I think (correct me if I&#039;m wrong). But I just got my copy of it for the PC and damn, it&#039;s probably the best game I&#039;ve played in a long time. And I haven&#039;t even played it for more than 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m blown away by it:<br />
- Cyber Commando&#039;s<br />
- Robots<br />
- Dragons<br />
- Awesome Weapons<br />
- Really Cool Graphics<br />
- Jokes<br />
- Foul Language<br />
- Good Music<br />
- Futuristic Stuff<br />
- The 80s<br />
<br />
Do I dare to say that I&#039;ve had more fun playing the first ~30 minutes of Blood Dragon than I had in the entire time I played Far Cry 3? Or is that taking it too far?<br />
<br />
If you like Far Cry 3, and haven&#039;t played Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, all I can say is that I highly recommend it.            </div>
