                I did not see this posted anywhere else, but i apologize if I just missed it.  <br />
<br />
Using BBLog version 2.2.1 in Chrome 20, no names are saved in my local user radar.  I can click on the radar icon, but if i leave the page and come back the icon is cleared, and if I click on the show/edit player list it is empty.  It seemed to work OK for me in Firefox, but that browser kept locking up on my PC so i had to stop using it.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  (I am new to the world of extensions and add-ons; been using IE all my internet life)<br />
<br />
Thanks!            </div>

                Nope!  I was opening the players in separate tabs.  But I just now tried radaring someone, then clicking the BF3 &quot;home&quot; button, then navigating to another player and radaring him and clicking home, and when I checked the list both players were still shown.  I closed Chrome completely and opend it again, and still saw both, so i think the issue may be resolved.  Thanks!!!            </div>

                yes thats the point. it doesnt work right if you work in more than one tab or if you are using the forward/backward button in the different browsers.            </div>
