                Hi all!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve a idea, but i don&#039;t know if it is good or not.<br />
How you think about a BBLog Board integration into Battlelog?<br />
I think about a simple frame integration that allows all registered battlelog users to write in our forums.<br />
<br />
What i expect from that?<br />
More and better feedback.            </div>

Sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
Do you think about adding something like the Forum search and New posts container on the right side of getbblog or what was your idea?<br />
<br />
Anyway, it would, as you already mentioned, most likely get you more viewers to write in the forums or search for problem solving, simply because its easier to click into a search bar or onto a forum link.            </div>

                I think about the board in general.<br />
<br />
With write access. So a user don&#039;t need to goto getbblog.com (most people don&#039;t care about this website) and than they can post directly in battlelog to our board.<br />
<br />
For people that don&#039;t have an account here i can make it simple with just entering manually their email to create an account on getbblog, than they be able to post.<br />
<br />
How integrate it? Just as a iframe that i integrate into battlelog, don&#039;t thought about the place right now.            </div>

I see. I guess that would be even better. People are lazy. Lol<br />
<blockquote><div class="user">BrainFooLong wrote:</div>How integrate it? Just as a iframe that i integrate into battlelog, don&#039;t thought about the place right now.</blockquote><br />
BBlog Forums button next to the Forums button and maybe even make it look like the official forums.            </div>

                You could set up a page similar to how the log-in via battlelog works. It would keep you on battlelog itself, but you would be able to adjust whatever you wanted. I&#039;m not even sure to what extent that would work.<br />
Another thing you could do is have two separate views for the bblog drop down menu, with a button to switch between the two. One view would have all of the options that we have now. The other would be a whole view dedicated to a compact version of the forums. That way you wouldn&#039;t have to worry about squeezing the forums in with the options.            </div>

Good idea, I think you should integrate it in a frame below the actual forum (same layout, same design)...make it more transparent/simple<br />
In addition maybe it will be useful to have : <br />
- check boxes in options to hide/show battlelog forum categories<br />
- few more important BBlog board categories and a &quot;view more activity/categories&quot; button to deploy all categories            </div>

                i think you and me already talked long time ago about this idea.<br />
(do you remember, i made you an offer to integrate our board in the general battlelog forum with an framework)<br />
<br />
you wasnt really about this idea because you thought a lof of people cound&#039;t see the difference between regular battlelog forum and getbblog.            </div>

Yep i know. But it&#039;s ok to re-consider some ideas :)<br />
The main idea is now to get more dynamic feedback for bblog. <br />
I don&#039;t want to make it &quot;seamless&quot; in battlelog, it should be clear for everyone that this is the bblog board. <br />
I don&#039;t know what we have exactly talked about previously but for fresh ideas i opened this thread.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s still much work when i do that, i&#039;m not sure actually in making this.            </div>

                I&#039;ll just make a list of possible pros and cons that I can think of with this idea.<br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
1. More feedback <div class="inline font-size-50">(BBLog, Plugins, Themes, Translations)</div><br />
2. More forum activity<br />
3. Communication between the BBLog Team and users will increase<br />
4. DICE/EA employees and/or Battlelog Moderators might start posting<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
1. More spam posts <div class="inline font-size-50">(and other rule breaking posts in general)</div><br />
<br />
I see it as 4 to 1, and would really like it if this idea was brought to life :-)            </div>

                So, after some testing and considering time i must reject my own idea.<br />
Too much work for a maybe useless feature or a feature that mess up our board with spam posts.            </div>
