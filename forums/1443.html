                I was reading the site in Dutch, thanks by the way for translating it to other languages, it makes it easier, and I saw some mistakes here and there. I went to the guy that translated everything&#039;s Battlelog Profile, and I saw he was German, so if you want, I can retranslate everything so there aren&#039;t that much mistakes. There are some kind of mistakes, that are basicly like: Don&#039;t are afraid to send us your new ideas. So if you want me to translate again, just e-mail me :D            </div>
