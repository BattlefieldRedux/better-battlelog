                This would primarily be used for making it easier to detect cheaters that use a modified damage hack.<br />
<br />
Look at the M16 for example, my M16 kills/hits (882/5240) ratio is 16.8% (which is pretty normal compared to everyone else that does not cheat) (Look at your own ratio as proof)<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://bf3stats.com/stats_pc/thediaperbuttkid</div><br />
This means that 16.8% of the time my bullet hits someone, I get a kill.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t take much effort at all to find a cheater on BF3 stats, so I will use this guy as an example of what a damage modified hack looks like.<br />
<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://bf3stats.com/stats_pc/XxXOneManArmyXxX</div><br />
His M16 stats show 314 kills with 503 hits. 62.4% of the time he hits someone, he gets a kill.<br />
(Because he is cheating. His bullets do 3x more damage than everyone else&#039;s. Also, look how high this ratio is for every other weapon he uses - way higher than yours.)<br />
<br />
My point is, that it would make catching a cheater easier using battlelog, if the computed kills/hits ratio was displayed for each weapon. I believe that if it is harder for a cheater to hide, the less of them will do it.            </div>

                There was a request like this before, i dont think its nessecary, thats why BF3stats are implemented and are providing a direct link to player&#039;s extended statistics.            </div>

                Yes, but you have to manually compute it on BF3stats. (I can do it, you can do it, but you have to admit there aren&#039;t a lot of math wizs&#039; out there)<br />
<br />
What I am suggesting would put the kills/hits ratio percentage right on each weapon&#039;s stats.<br />
<br />
Here is another example of someone discovering a cheater by looking at a player&#039;s stats:<br />

                Should be a thing for a plugin not for a main BBLog feature. <br />
The existing HS Rate and Fired / Hit display is pretty much enough.            </div>
