Thanks Juress for reporting this for me. Didn&#039;t mean to get anyone yelled at....sheesh<br />
<br />
Anyway yeah, after this latest Chrome update and the latest BBLog update installed, users on my &quot;user radar&quot; list do not show up below the server name anymore. I have confirmed that my user list is populated with users and users in that list are currently on the server.<br />
<br />
If I click on their profile the Radar indicator light is lit, however, they do not appear under the server name in the server browser area.<br />
<br />
The &quot;server radar&quot; function seems to be working properly.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to say, this problem just started after these latest updates. Maybe i should try to re-install the plugin. just though i would mention it in IRC to see if others were having the same problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks again juress.....            </div>

                I need to know what radar you exactly use for which case.<br />
<br />
For the best testing do the following:<br />
1. Save your current settings in the cloud.<br />
2. Click on &quot;Access Key&quot; on the newly created entry and post the access key here.            </div>

                Same for me... I really like the Better Battlelog <br />
<br />
but for some reason the Local User Radar does not show if a player I have in my Radar is on the server.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve removed it and re-installed it.. went to a server on my favorites and just picked a few active players and added them to the User Radar just to test.. and they don&#039;t show up at all.<br />
<br />
Really liked that feature for those suspect players who play on some servers I play on regularly.. Just so when I see them on .. I don&#039;t go play.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was hoping to have a download for a previous version of BBlog to see if it works in it but you only have the latest version available.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks            </div>

It&#039;s fixed in the next release.<br />
<br />
PM Brain and maybe he will send you an updated fix before then. He did for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks Brain.            </div>
