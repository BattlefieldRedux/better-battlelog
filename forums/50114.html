                Hi Community, i am Roland, Developer and Admin of Better Battlelog!<br />
<br />
BBLog is nearly 1 year old and it has become a bigger thing that i ever had imagined.<br />
<br />
Since Version 3.0.0 the Daily User Peak is over 4000 People Online, at the same time, with our BBLog Addon. This is 2x times more than before 3.0.0.<br />
<br />
Better Battlelog requires a lot of interaction with the BBLog Server to work properly, for example the Image Upload for Platoons or the PDF Generator for Battlereports.<br />
<br />
But i have one big problem. Server Capacity.<br />
The BBLog Server can&#039;t handle so much requests anymore.<br />
<br />
At the moment, i pay the server from my own pocket. Which is 360&euro; per Year.<br />
<br />
A Server that can handle all required things yet and also in the near future costs 600&euro; per Year.<br />
<br />
I definitely not will pay more money as i currently does from my own pocket.<br />
<br />
So the thing that i want to point out with this thread is that i have now 3 options<br />
<br />
1. Get a new server that can handle current requests (min. Requirements: Root Dedicated Server, Quad Core, 4GB Ram). I don&#039;t buy one.<br />
---<br />
2. Turn off Better Battlelog (what i don&#039;t will do)<br />
----<br />
3. Remove Better Battlelog Features that requires the Server (Platoon Images, PDF Generator, etc...) That&#039;s what i will do.<br />
<br />
Advertisment like Google Ads is no option, the most people doesn&#039;t visit the website, they just use BBLog on Battlelog. So there be no income.<br />
The only way to keep all current features is a sponsored Root Server for BBLog.<br />
<br />
For all those really want to donate for BBLog, just contact me via private message.<br />
<br />
Sorry for that people but there is no other way anymore to handle this massive user interest.            </div>

                Bad news indeed... and what about a &quot;freemium&quot; version of BBlog ?<br />
Free basic BBlog add&#039;on (without some features) and paid version (with image upload, pdf generator...)<br />
<br />
Daily User Peak is over 4000 People Online...if 20% of these will paid 1&euro; for year for an Extended BBlog, it will be great ?!            </div>

                I can offer some ressource for BBLog. I&#039;m using it for some other projects too, but there should be enough performance to balance to load between some servers. <br />

Thats what i currently have and that&#039;s one of the bottlenecks. <br />
Thx for the offer but a &quot;shared&quot; root or balancing over multiple servers isn&#039;t helpful in this case.            </div>

Well thats true, but especially the platoon upload feature makes absolutely no sense to limit it to a hand of user&#039;s.            </div>

                Why do you don&#039;t add a donation clock or goal to the website. BBlog is an awesome feature and I would be glad to help out. Unfortunately I can&#039;t spare much, but already small donations can effect a lot.<br />
<br />
I mean, just 240 persons have to think like me and spend 1 Euro to get you to the 600 Euro you mentioned. And I am pretty sure that more people would like to support the service you are offering for free, so that even your own costs about 360 Euro per year would be maybe lowered.            </div>

                I&#039;m not one for donation buttons either, but if some site has one and it&#039;s just there, I wouldn&#039;t mind it.<br />
It&#039;s until they start saying things like: If you want to help us, donate whatever you want, every bit helps.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s when I start to protest against donation options. It should just be there for users to spare some money if THEY choose to, and not because the site promotes the option to do so and makes them out to be special/better if they do.            </div>

I do understand that. But a donation is made by choice (at least in my definition), it&#039;s not forced and you can be sure that the donator just want to to express his gratitude for the work all you have done.            </div>

                Maybe a lot of people would help with a donation.. it could be easiest for them if you install a paypal button ?!            </div>

                As most of people here don&#039;t feel bothered by a donation button and i also would try it out, i have installed a small button in the top navigation for paypal donations.<br />

Thats what i currently have and that&#039;s one of the bottlenecks. <br />
Thx for the offer but a &quot;shared&quot; root or balancing over multiple servers isn&#039;t helpful in this case.<br />

<br />
Why not? Instead of downloading all files from one server you could download some from a second one. For example with the Battlereports: Instead that your server makes the work, a other one can do it - More functions and your server must do it.<br />
<br />
CDN like amazonaws would be solution too - but not free - would save you many traffic and serves the files much faster. You could finance it with the help of some donations :)<br />
<br />
Two servers would be better I think: So you only have the same costs like before and you don&#039;t need to think about to pay more, when the next month comes less donations.<br />
<br />
Just an idea - It&#039;s up to you :)            </div>

I&#039;ve found a sponsor that give me a much more powerful root server.<br />
That means that features not must be deleted, if everything will work fine with our sponsor.<br />
