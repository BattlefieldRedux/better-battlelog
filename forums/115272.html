                Hi, my first post and it has to be a bug report. I am playing on PS4 and using BBL/Battlelog on macbook to connect to servers, as the server browser in ps4 is horrible. <br />
<br />
Currently I cannot see ping numbers with BBL on any servers, just a &quot;-&quot;-sign/symbol. I can click to arrange servers descending/ascending by ping and it seems to work (not sure though, cannot see the ping values), and all other fields and filters of data are working. I have the server pings working on PC, just the macbook seems to be kaput. Tested with two broswers; safari and chrome.<br />
<br />
I hope someone reads this, it is a little thing but annoying one.            </div>

                Are the pings showing up if you disable Better Battlelog?            </div>
