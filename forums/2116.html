Just the alpha build... How this Beta (or RC?!) release is going? Gameplay, ping and other things?            </div>

This is the final game. I can play campaign, multiplayer and all the other things of the game.            </div>

                Nice, so give us some insider information, how does the game feel? <br />
How different is it from BF3? (not content wise, more engine/game feel in general)            </div>

                Firstly, I have to join a server or play the campaign per ingame. Horrible!<br />
I&#039;ll be happy, if Battlelog is released to use it for MoH.<br />
<br />
You have 2-man squads and if you are ingame, you can&#039;t change your squad. You have to create a Party with your friends and then join a server so that all of you are splited in 2-man squads and no-one is alone. (Until we understood this, we really really rejoined!)<br />
<br />
The game feels smoother than battlefield. I don&#039;t know why this is (more fps, ...) but it&#039;s great! It looks like battlefield, just frostbite engine. The game runs better on my PC than battlefield, probably because the maps are smaller.<br />
<br />
2 weeks ago, I didn&#039;t want the game, but now I would buy it!<br />
<br />
Later, I&#039;ll upload some gameplays. stay tuned!<br />
