                Isn&#039;t a Better Battlelog nor Battlefield thing. People in India need to buy/rent servers located in India.<br />

Unfortunately, DICE stopped selling rights for server renting and there is no date set for a next wave.<br />
Until then, there won&#039;t be any Indian servers.            </div>

and is that a problem? there are so many other servers on the world with have good connection, to india too. and i think DICE have a good reason why they have stopped the selling rights.            </div>

Well apparently, when you&#039;re trying to connect from India to the closest server, they still have latency over 250ms, which is pretty close to unplayable.            </div>
