                So the TS overlay doesn&#039;t work anymore, but I don&#039;t know if it did what I&#039;m going to request here<br />
<br />
There&#039;s the vehicle respawn overlay that works great, is there a way to get a TS3 overlay that shows up just on the battlemap so you can see who is on and possibly talking while you have the battlemap open on a different monitor?  Even if it just updates every minute or so to show who is on and not who is talking it would be pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
Thanks            </div>

What TS overlay?<br />
<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://www.overwolf.com/</div> has a great TS3 overlay function, which unfortunately did not really work with BF3 back in the days, but they might updated it.            </div>

I guess it wasn&#039;t an overlay but a plugin for the side of BBL. I&#039;ve tried Overwolf, and I don&#039;t really like it, but the way PB is I don&#039;t want to put any sort of overlay onto the game, hell someone just got banned for using an xfire setting.            </div>

Why?<br />
<br />
Does a plugin request not go in the request section?            </div>

                Its not clear what this topic is about.<br />
BBLog not have a TS overlay natively.<br />
<br />
Plugins must be added manually from your side, you have not confirmed that you used a plugin.<br />
When you use a plugin and it not work anymore, go ahead and search the plugin thread in the plugins section.<br />
<br />
And last but not least, plugin requests are also for the plugins section, not for the BBLog native Feature Request forums.<br />
