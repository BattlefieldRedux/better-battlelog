                what i dont understand is that you erase the assignment &#039;collecting all ribbons&#039; and &#039;collecting all medals&#039; and now there is &#039;destroy 5000! vehicles with your vehicle&#039; the other two i had accomplished and seems to me they are easy to accomplishing than the new one i&#039;m colonol 100 and still need 2000 more!<br />
<br />
if you can change it to &#039;destroy 5000 vehicles&#039; without beiing in one?<br />
<br />
Just like the 10000 revives i did it but its way too mutch! or you can change the number 5000 by do less like 4000 or 3000??<br />
<br />
I can image that somebody new (level 1) thinks its too mutch! and not doiing the effort of completing them because its too mutch.<br />
<br />
Are you guys keeping the assignment or change him too less than 5000??<br />
