                A feature that me and friends discussed would be a good feature to add. Gives more information to the user about what gun they perform well with (along side SPM and accuracy.)<br />

That i think would be a big load on BF3stats database, so you should use BF3stats.com instead. Its not that far away, under the graph from BF3stats in your battlelog profile is a link to complete statistics on BF3stats.com.            </div>
