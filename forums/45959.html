                Clean install of BBlog 3.0.0 on Firefox<br />
<br />
2 problems<br />
<br />
1. In server browser servers that have been added to radar dont show the red radar icon next to them anymore.<br />
they only show the red text &quot;this server is on your radar when you click on the server in the list.<br />

<br />
2. The BBlog icon that lets you change the options of BBlog becomes randomly unresponsive so it doesnt do anything at all and requires me to log out of battlelog and back in. After that it works until it randomly becomes unresponsive again.            </div>

                1. Normally it has a light-red background instead of the icon now. But this theme override it as i could see.<br />
2. Never heard this before. Maybe it&#039;s because of our todays server problems. Please be patient and report in a few days again if the problem still exist.            </div>

                You were right about the theme overriding the radar icon. Did not expect that as I used the same theme before and it worked correctly. Hope you get your servers in order soon. Thanks for the help.            </div>

The theme was re-created from scratch, so there might be some pieces missing. <br />
This will be corrected in the next update - servers on your radar will be marked with red borders.<br />
