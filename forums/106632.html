                <div class="tag tag-b">Yay</div>, you are already able to pre-order Battlefield 4 Premium: <div class="inline post-url">http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/buy</div> Moderators in forum are seeking clarification, if people who pre-ordered are going to get some kind of discount, but I am pretty sure nothing like that is going to happen, because why should they? Milking the cash cow wouldn&#039;t be as effective as it is now.<br />
<br />
You could probably bring the argument that I don&#039;t need Premium to play BF4, but I always love to get the full experience and in my opinion Premium is a part of this.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s see what the future brings, but hey, it&#039;s EA, guess I/We shouldn&#039;t get your hopes up.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?<br />

                I do it in the same way as in BF3 because the complete marketing strategy is the same.<br />
I buy both, but this time not via Origin, i use a official key store which have a 25% discount for BF4 and premium.<br />
<br />
I think that BF4 will have more content than BF3.<br />
And all people that flame around because of paying 100$+ dollar for a game - It was always the same for every other game too. Expansion packs, DLC, etc... <br />
<br />
EA is in this way not the cheapest but also not the most expensive publisher. <br />
<br />
I see it positive to already know that premium contain all future content, for other games you can&#039;t even get a full package and you must pay every single extension for the game, which will cost more than a package.<br />
<br />

                I can see it already, one to two months after the game rls, they start selling Battlefield 4 Premium Edition for $60. I have no illusions ;)            </div>

Hm, this is actually a good idea. I pre-ordered BF4 on amazon, because I do want to have the Steelbook edition (I just like to collect games old school in a cupboard), but this could be pretty legit for Premium. I guess buying it in India for super cheap won&#039;t work this time. What key store do you personally prefer?<br />

I think so too.<br />

This was actually the reason why I bought Premium, to get access to all DLC&#039;s in one package + cheaper than buying them one by one. Exclusive 2XP, Dog tags, etc are nice to have but I don&#039;t really need that.            </div>

                Personally I&#039;ll wait for a cheap &quot;Premium Edition&quot; version of the game. IMO BF3 Premium was terrible, 50&euro; for 4/5 DLCs (which content was unknown) and worthless extra stuff like &quot;exclusive&quot; images or dog tags. I don&#039;t know how BF4 Premium is gonna be, but after BF3 I&#039;m gonna be really cautious before giving EA/DICE my money again.            </div>
