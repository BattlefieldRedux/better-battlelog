                I was on the <div class="inline post-url">https://twitter.com/#!/BetterBattlelog</div> twitter and found this interesting tweet <div class="inline post-url">https://twitter.com/#!/NM_Jeff/status/198513990928830465</div><br />
I downloaded it and it&#039;s a really nice add-on, it has a some really helpful tweaks and features. If it&#039;s used together with BBLog, well, let&#039;s just say that the result is awesome.<br />
<br />
As much as I like the add-on I&#039;m going to keep it deactivated, that is unless it gets fully compatible with BBLog. If Roland and the creator of BattlelogPlus would work together and make both add-ons fully compatible with each other it would be really nice.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I have tried it a little bit and the only thing that I see is interfering with BBLog is the awards page. Also, I don&#039;t know how this works with saving server filters seeing as it changes some options.            </div>

                Tried it. Not bad, but some things don&#039;t work. Hopefully roland can contact the creator and make some awesome add-on together. :D            </div>

                Well, does anyone know what&#039;s happened to this project?<br />
I see absolutely no changes since few months, the forums is completely full with spam and it looks like the admin is gone.            </div>

                It seems pretty much dead. Too bad because it has some cool features.            </div>
