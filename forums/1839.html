                these should be fairly painless to incorporate.  im surprised no one has suggested them yet.<br />
<br />
(1) add basic platoon stats on the main page<br />
(2) one addition stat (for the main page) platoon W/L average (average based on members W/L)<br />
<br />
mockup attached below (pardon the mess ... i put this together very quickly)<br />

                For this first, it&#039;s easy to click on the stats tab. Copy basic stats to another page isn&#039;t very reasonable.<br />
Other, W/L or advanced average stats of all clan members, no. This requires a request to battlelog servers for EVERY clan member to fetch this data.<br />
BBLog doesn&#039;t support features that requires a lot of extra requests to servers.            </div>

                your right it is easy to click on the stats tab. that isn&#039;t the point / idea.<br />
<br />
the idea is to display a snapshot of the platoon&#039;s overall performance.  (i.e. how good are these guys?)<br />
<br />
as for platoon W/L ... no need for BLOG to do any advanced functions that will bog down the server.  BF3stats.com which has already been successfully integrated pulls this data into a single form. (i.e. leaderboards)  <br />
<br />
each platoon would just have to enter the public URL of their BF3stats leaderboard.            </div>
