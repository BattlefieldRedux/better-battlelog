                Hi all!<br />
<br />
As the title say, we search a community manager for BBLog. I don&#039;t really have time to make a good community management and for that reason it&#039;s better to search a more qualified person for that.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u">What you need to do as a community manager for BBLog?</div><br />
* If we have news to publish - For example new releases, important news, etc... - Post it on all relevant social sites of BBLog like Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc...<br />
* Collecting Feedback from those social sites and filter/summarize it for me and the team<br />
* Be the main pipe between community and the BBLog team - You should be the main person who stand for community communication<br />
* Make BBLog even more public - Find new ways for PR of BBLog<br />
* Improvement/Userbility research - What can we do better, not only in the addon - For example the homepage addon description, the forums, new communication channels, etc...<br />
* Organizing some community events, like BF matches on a server, or something like that<br />
* Maybe some other similar jobs that i don&#039;t know yet<br />
* Be active in one hour per week is recommended, more is better<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u">What can we offer for you?</div><br />
Well, pretty much nothing, expect to be part of BBLog :) <br />
We, the whole team, do it all for free and in our free time and we don&#039;t make any money with BBLog.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u">Skills required</div><br />
* Very good english skills<br />
* Smooth and non aggressive in discussions - Always be objective and don&#039;t let you disturb by flame and whine posts. Just stand on top of such people :)<br />
* Some experience in community management and PR<br />
* Good experience with most common social sites<br />
* 20+ years old<br />
<br />

This is flexible. You are a faitfhul BBLog member, so the age doesn&#039;t matter here.<br />

                Good to hear and know that you&#039;re pass some of your tasks as founder of BBLog. However, i would recommend you to split the tasks of a &#039;Community Manager&#039; into multiple jobs. e.g. A community manager should not have as main task searching for or do PR related stuff. You can make another &#039;job&#039; such as &#039;PR Manager&#039; and some other jobs which you can split up.<br />
<br />
The main task of a Community Manager should be handling all questions of the community and bring the community hot news on all possible platforms.<br />
The main task of a PR Manager should be promoting BBLog on all possible platforms and finding new ways to &#039;cover our ground&#039; such as collaborations with other Game related sites.<br />
<br />
And no, I do reply quite often on this board, but I read every post. My age and all other stats are in compliance with your requirements, so if you need any help, you know where to find me.            </div>

                Hi!<br />
<br />
Thanks Brain. This is a big task for me, I will do my best. I&#039;m thinking for the beginning of an event that I will organize for the German players in battlefield 4 - more info will follow later, be patient. There will also be changes in our nice forum ( Theme/Art contests, BF Stats in every profile / in/under every post etc. )<br />

                Hi everyone,<br />
I decided to resign from the position of a Community Manager. Since September I don&#039;t have that much free time, and even less to dedicate to BBLog and I don&#039;t even play much BF these days. I&#039;ll still try to visit the forums when I can, but I feel it won&#039;t be enough to properly do the job of a Community Manager.            </div>
