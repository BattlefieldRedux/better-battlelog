                Valve has done it again :) They&#039;ve started Beta Testing a feature called Overwatch to CS:GO that let&#039;s <div class="tag tag-i">chosen</div> users pass a verdict on suspected cheaters by watching recorded gameplay of them.<br />
<br />
If done right, this can surly halt cheating in a big way. Not only will bans be issued faster, but more cheaters will be caught as well.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, the more a user votes (correctly) and is active within Overwatch, that user&#039;s votes will count for more, when being compared to a new Overwatch user.<br />
<br />
This is something that Battlefield could use as well. If it&#039;s proven to be successful in CS:GO, I hope more companies will put it in their games as well.<br />

                Meh, it&#039;s either gonna be very successful or a big disaster, it all depends on the players, and personally I don&#039;t trust most of them.            </div>
