                When I go to create and save a new filter it acts like it&#039;s reloading the list of server but just stops. I have to reload the page then save it again for it to actually save.<br />
I hope that made sense.            </div>

                What do you mean? Do you mean the &quot;Save and Reload&quot; Button? Do you mean the &quot;Filterset&quot; Button?<br />
Which Browser do you have? Which BBLog Version do you use?<br />
So less information, we can&#039;t help.            </div>

                I have the same problem with latest Chrome and Firefox version. It has nothing to do with BBLog, it&#039;s a bug from battlelog itself. I disabled BBLog and it still happened to me.<br />
<br />
For clarification; the problem is that when you change something in the filter settings (e.g. Change Hardcore to Normal mode) it will try to refresh the server list, but it stops &#039;rolling&#039; after a while. You need to &#039;F5&#039; the page and it will work again. :-)<br />

As Brain said, unfortunately we can&#039;t help you.            </div>

                Ok I go to the Server Browser, I check off what I want for my filters. I click &quot;refresh and save filters&quot;. Then I click on My filtersets-&gt;Save active settings, I name it and click OK.<br />
That is when the problem comes in. Some times it works and other times it doesn&#039;t. Either way the normal thing seems to be that it reloads the list of servers. When it doesn&#039;t work the reload just sits there and the filter set wasn&#039;t saved. I have to refresh the whole page using the browser and do the &quot;Save active settings&quot; again and then it usually works.<br />
Using the latest version of BBlog<br />

Sorry for not painting a clear enough picture before I was being pulled in 3 other directions while trying to do this at the same time last night. Hopefully this one is clear enough.            </div>

                Well as we said, no BBLog issue.            </div>
