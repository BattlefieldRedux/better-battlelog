                Hey BBlog team,<br />
<br />
first of all I want to thank you for your amazing work you have done in the past and will do in the future. It&#039;s getting better and better with every new version and v3 (+ redesigned website) looks amazing.<br />
<br />
Actually I just have one note. The forum design fits nice into the new website, but it&#039;s pretty hard to tell if there are new topics or comment. Of course you can take a look at the right side and watch out for a changed date, but that&#039;s actually (at least for me) a little bit intricately. A icon that shows new topics or new comments (like in the old version) would be really sweet.<br />
<br />
I know, it&#039;s just little things, bblog v3 is brand new and you will probably implement it. I just wanted to give you a feedback and some commendation. ;-) <div class="tag tag-b">Keep up your good work!</div><br />
<br />
PS. I am sorry if I missed a recent task list.            </div>
