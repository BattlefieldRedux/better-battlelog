                Hi all!<br />
<br />
A new version is out right now with some minor improvements and new features. See the changelog for more information.<br />
<br />
To all firefox users!<br />
<br />
Now it is the time, Better Battlelog requires some changes.<br />
Mozilla forces all extension developers to &quot;sign&quot; there addons.<br />
All unsigned addons will be deactivated in the near future.<br />
Signing an addon means that mozilla review all addon&#039;s for security reasons, like google chrome already do since 2 years.<br />
<br />
This step is also required for BBLog. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately some steps are required by you in order to work with BBLog in the future.<br />
Follow the instructions and you&#039;re ready for the future with BBLog.<br />
<br />
1. Backup BBLog settings with the &quot;Export Settings&quot; in the top left of the BBLog options menu.<br />
2. Delete Better Battlelog from your Firefox Addons.<br />
3. Goto <div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com/install</div> and download the new firefox version<br />
4. Import your backup settings with the &quot;Import Settings&quot; in the top left of the BBLog options menu.<br />
5. Done<br />
<br />
The new version is signed by mozilla and you&#039;re ready for the breaking change in the new firefox versions.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the unpleasantness but it&#039;s required by mozilla.<br />
