                I finally got access to the letsencrypt.com beta program and i already have installed a SSL certificate for getbblog.com.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s enabled now by default for all urls. This massively improve the security for all our users.<br />
<br />
Some time later i will enable https support also for our addon.<br />
This means that it will work on https urls in battlelog as well.<br />

That have nothing todo with the SSL cert, if you check that in your FF console than you will notice that this is because of some external images here, for example the BF4stats images in the signatures.            </div>

Thanks, no problem.<br />
I often heard people complaining about that those free certs must be a lack of security, i don&#039;t think so.<br />
Well, i would not use it for a homepage with very sensible data, like e-banking or something like that.<br />
But for the most websites in the web that only act with some community/user features this as good enough. Definetely better as without encryption :)<br />
Without encryption 100% of the traffic can be sniffed, with encryption only the few people that can crack the encryption can listen to the traffic.<br />
