                The new fall patch added the ability to change various HUD elements in game. Why not be able to do this on the battlescreen?            </div>

                Because it&#039;s simply not possible. The thing is that your BF game settings are not synchronized with battlelog.<br />

You&#039;re right they aren&#039;t synced, that&#039;s why its a feature request. I was thinking to inject some html/css and blow up the little icons. I really don&#039;t know if its technically impossible.            </div>

Battlescreen is a part of battlelog. It&#039;s not in the game.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s for people with dual monitors. They can have a large minimap for their second screen. There is a button on the server bar at the bottom of battlelog after you join a server that says &quot;battlescreen.&quot; Click this button.<br />

Brain knows the game enough good, so he can say if its possible or not.<br />
if he says it isnt that he have a reason. if its a part of battlelog (website) there would be another barrier.<br />
if you know it works, than write/create a plugin, maybe brain will learn something.. ;-)            </div>

                Well, i&#039;ve missunderstood that request until yet :)<br />
I always thought you want to change it in the game.<br />
<br />
To change it just on the battlescreen is possible, but i definetely don&#039;t want to do it :)<br />
Maybe a plugin creator can help you.            </div>
