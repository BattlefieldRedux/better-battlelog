                Sry for my bad english.<br />
<br />
I have A problem with the All Rounder Assigmant.<br />
<br />
I`m a bad players,  so i was very happy  to have a round how i has done  11605 Points with a Recon. I got 47 kills in the round. First time that i got so much.<br />
<br />
So  I have take a loog on the Assigmant     the kill over 40  was complete.<br />
But the thing Get more than 10.000 Points in Tota      happen nothing?<br />
<br />
When i got 11605 Points in a round i thing its over 10000?  or thing im wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
So i ask me why i dident get the assigment.  That the first time that i get so much points a round.  So im a bit angry that the assigment dident complete :(<br />
<br />
Its a bug   or have i understand somthing wrong on the Assigment?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here two pictures<br />
first  not complet assigment<br />
second bf3 stats from iphone.<br />
The green points are the las points that i have done    11605  as a Recon<br />

                It&#039;s not a bug, it&#039;s just a bit tricky to check it.<br />
<br />
The point is, the posted battlereport isn&#039;t your best (or a better one that you already have).<br />
You have reached 5 goals in the battlereport you posted.<br />
<br />
In a previous report you also reached 5 (other) goals. So no update is done because the reached goals are equal, which means that you don&#039;t had a better round than ever before (in relation to this assignment goals).            </div>

                dont know i have a better round  for the game brake that i have done....<br />
<br />
but im still wrong or stand there that i just need to get 10000 Points?<br />
<br />
how stand that must be my best round ever how i get more then 10000 points<br />
<br />
wrong discription for this assignment?        <br />
<br />
I read just that i must make over 10000 Points that i have done.<br />
ORFK was so friendly to send a offizell link from the points.<br />
<br />
So i dident understand why you talking somthing over that must be my best round???<br />
over 10000 Points are over 10000 points   and  how ever seen the assigment just saw that the need to do  over 10000 Points :O            </div>

Fact is, if you don&#039;t have a better battlereport (sum of reached goals) it don&#039;t be saved, as i said before.<br />
In this case the user already had reached 5 goals before the BR in this topic.            </div>

                AHA! So if user A have reached task 1, 2, 3 and 4 (in total 4) in an old battlereport and in an newser one he reachs the tasks 1, 2, 6 and 7 (in total 4) it shows on the assigment pages still the tasks from 1, 2, 3 and 4? because in total he have 4/7 and the new battlereport with 4/7 ist not better?<br />
<br />
so if he wants to have an update he need f.e. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 (5/7)?<br />
<br />
and in his last battlereport with the more than 10&#039;000 points he have only reached the tasks Skill, Kills, Death, Help by Kills and Points (in total 4)<br />

Yes it so, to save reports with lower total score makes no sense, that&#039;s the reason why it is so.<br />
Many people will get pissed of when they see, &quot;hey i reached 5 goals&quot;, next day &quot;WTF why i now have only 4 reached?&quot;. Just for explanation.            </div>

no, you already reached once 4/7 tasks (in an older battlereport i search it for you later)<br />
this is saved now. with your last battlereport (wich i have posted) you reached again 4/7 (different) tasks, but it not saved because at the end its the same, only 4/7.<br />
<br />
if you would reach 5/7 it will be showed up in on the assigment page, because 5/7 is more than 4/7. but if its still 4/7 it won&#039;t be overwritten. is it clear now?<br />
