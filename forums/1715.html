                Hey,<br />
<br />
I post on the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; Thread and as of late a lot of R34 has managed to make its way onto the thread via a few very bad users.<br />
<br />
A Few suggestions regarding the Flame radar:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><div class="user">Show who the Flamer is | wrote:</div>User &quot;A&quot; might just be a troll who&#039;s posts are SFW. However User B might be a user who posts NSFW, I don&#039;t want to open their posts when in the company of others.</blockquote><blockquote><div class="user">Hide Flame User Quotes | wrote:</div><br />
Sometimes we just don&#039;t want to know at all, it might be appropriate to hide quotes of flame users as well.<br />
</blockquote><blockquote><div class="user">Make Flamed posts re-hidable | wrote:</div><br />
If I am in the company of others and I click on an R34 Post I don&#039;t want to have to wait for  the page to refresh, I should be able to re-hide the post.<br />
</blockquote><blockquote><div class="user">Option to disable inline images of flame posts | wrote:</div><br />
Sometimes I might want to read a flamed post BUT the images might be NSFW in which case I do not want them inline.<br />

Those 3 sounds okay, the &#039;Hide Flame User Quotes&#039; sounds like it would come to use the most.<br />
Though, seeing as people other than the flame user is posting the quotes. They could easily troll people and just make a fake quote leading to the user in question being put in the flame radar for no reason at all.            </div>

                Impossible with the current system for flame radar.<br />
Requires a complete rewrite of this feature.<br />
Currently i don&#039;t have the time for it.            </div>
