                I would suggest giving the ability to add attachments to weapons and then having the graph change according to that. The plot is really nice however it does not allow for a much more accurate representation based on what you prefer on your gun.            </div>

                Its definetly too much work to have graph for every combination of any possible attachment and weapon.<br />
Sorry, it will never be integrated. You must calculate that stuff manually.<br />
What will maybe come in the future is more detailed attachment information.            </div>

                fair enought, i was thinking more allong the lines of a integrated graph calculator built into bblog which calculates on the fly, if that is even possible            </div>

                I also thought about on the fly calculator.<br />
This is so huge work and maybe not really possible, maybe it comes in the future but i cannot promise it.<br />
