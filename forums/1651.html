                Some of you might know this already, but for all the others it&#039;s very useful!<br />
<br />
Battlefield 3 graphics ain&#039;t the best, there is a weird blue layer on top of it, almost everybody is annoyed by it. However, there was a time called Alpha and Beta where the blue layer wasn&#039;t there, yet.<br />
Some dev&#039;s were looking into the codes and found a possibility to disable that blue layer, so all colors would be more realistic. There are two different &quot;FXAA injector&#039;s&quot;, they both do they same. It&#039;s just which one you prefer the most.<br />

I prefer the injector from Some Dude, because the new Danoc1 version has got some bugs in it. All texts (scoreboard, names, etc.) are blurred. He knows about it and is working on it. They both look great, and more realistic to me.<br />

Isn&#039;t true, FXAA Injector changes the running programm code in a similar way as hacks does. I know reports (don&#039;t ask me where i read it) that mean that you CAN get kicked by punkbuster.<br />

Currently PB won&#039;t ban anyone (http://board.ggc-stream.com/showthread.php/12436-Custom-FXAA-tool-created.?p=89693&amp;viewfull=1#post89693). In the future, who knows.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know how an hack works but I&#039;ve read that this should works in the same way most graphic tools work (see nVidia/AMD control panel, MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision and so on...).            </div>

                I&#039;ve heard about the FXAA injectors before but I&#039;ve never really tried and/or paid attention to them until now. I got to say though, the game looks a lot better with the FXAA injector :)<br />
<br />
At the moment I use the following tools for BF3:<br />
1) Game Booster (not because of bad PC, but for even more power)<br />
2) BF3 Settings Editor (the Realmware version)<br />
3) danoc1&#039;s FXAA injector<br />
EDIT: I also give bf3.exe high CPU priority in the task manager<br />
<br />
With all those three tools the game runs and looks like never before, the good way :)            </div>

Well it closes unnecessary programs and services while it&#039;s activated, this can give you some FPS boost but usually nothing more than 40% (at least for me).            </div>

It depend on how you modify it, or choose what tasks to kill so to say.<br />
I&#039;ve gotten mixed results, as I have the settings now it gives me a 46% boost.            </div>

i have done. DICE and some of the DICE employees didn&#039;t answer... it&#039;s the fourth time that i write a twitter message to them. The EA Support is much faster than them. I begin to think, they don&#039;t want to give an answer of these questions.<br />

                Just one point: If anyone here play any competitive league, don&#039;t use this.<br />
As far as I know, UAC3 (TWL) ban users that use FXAA.<br />

<br />
Isn&#039;t true, FXAA Injector changes the running programm code in a similar way as hacks does. I know reports (don&#039;t ask me where i read it) that mean that you CAN get kicked by punkbuster.<br />

                had the same discusion with Gamm4 (EA Community Manager).<br />
The thread can still stay here in the Forum, EA generally didn&#039;t allow to use the Mod, but they won&#039;t ban any accounts. same for PB.            </div>

                Well, so far none has been banned (AFAIK) and if they&#039;re gonna ban everyone using it they should tell us.            </div>

I tried out both of them but none of them seem to work for me . After I copy / install the files to the main folder , some of the games just wont start ( battlefield3.exe has stopped working ) . And If a game actually starts then the Injector is not even working . Any idea ? Same problems ? Let me know pls. THX :)            </div>
