                2 different assignments, maybe 3.<br />
<br />
Name: Primary Weapons Master<br />
Goal: Get 500 kills with each Primary weapons; Assault, Engineer, Support, Recon, Shotgun, and PDW<br />
The M26 Mass would have to could as a shotgun even though it&#039;s a gadget.<br />
<br />
Name: Pistol Master<br />
Goal: Get 500 kills with each Pistols<br />
<br />
Possible 3rd idea.<br />
Name: Gadget Master<br />
Goal: Get 500 kills with each; RPG, SMAW, M320, Stinger, IGLA, Javelin, Xbow and Xbow Scoped.<br />
Optionally add: C4, Claymore, AT Mines, Mortar.<br />
Before someone asks, &#039;why not the repair tool, eod bot or mav, maybe even the defib?&#039; while they can be used as weapons that is not they their purpose is.<br />
<br />
Instead of listing each weapon maybe it can just calculate it base on percentage.<br />
If I counted them correctly there are 60 Primary weapons and using me as an example, I have 22 weapons at 500+, show it should show up as having 2.72% completed.            </div>

having 100 Stars with the M16 is way too easy - this would be much better.            </div>
