                Couple of very minor things I though I would mention as I saw there is supposed to be an update released tomorrow .... <br />
<br />
The user radar &quot;target&quot; is not centered on the users profile page anymore. Target need to come down a notch or two. <br />
<br />
Also, is there anyway we could have better battlelog save the page &quot;sort&quot; preferences on the servers history tab? I like to have my servers sorted by number of players on the servers, but when I navigate away from the page it resets this and I have to click the tab at the top again to sort when I return. <br />
<br />
Like I said, minor things ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the hard work you people do with this plugin ...            </div>

                First, thanks for reporting.<br />
Second, i guess this was always available in battlelog, but since a few time ago i doesn&#039;t work anymore.<br />
I think DICE need something to do. I wait some time for it.            </div>
