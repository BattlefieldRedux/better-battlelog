Well, this news is pure evil for BBLog.<br />
This news means that BBLog will not longer work on chrome when they change this.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have a Google Dev Account, i don&#039;t want to pay for a Dev Account and i don&#039;t want to change BBLog especially to fit the horrible TOS of Chrome Apps.<br />
<br />
In any way a catastrophic thing - Let us hope that chrome add a option to allow us this in the future, with a opt-in or something like that.            </div>

                I got an account there. I&#039;m not sure, but I think I can add other members of a &quot;development team&quot;, so you could update it. Another thing I&#039;ve read out of the text is that you can still install extensions from outside if you&#039;ve enabled the developer mode on chrome://extensions (enable - install - disable)<br />

                The account isn&#039;t the real problem - The TOS are more the problem. BBLog do not fit that because of plugin support (script injection), external api access, hotfix possibility, etc... <br />
<br />
And the text means that LOCAL installation is possible - That means you must extract a zip file to your hard drive and add the extension via that local data - No auto update possible.<br />
<br />
Read the shitstorm bellow this text, the shitstorm wouldn&#039;t be if the installation is still possible in dev mode :)            </div>

                It sounds a bit strange but you shouldn&#039;t care about the TOS that much. My developer account is really old and I have a few extensions published (Never had issues with publishing new ones, while other developers had... Seems like mine is on a whitelist or sth). It is a try worth it.<br />

Oh, I missunderstood it then. There basically were no comments when I read the post...            </div>

                Chrome mostly had the same TOS as Firefox.<br />
And BBLog didn&#039;t fit Firefox TOS in the past - Not got approved because of that i already said.<br />
The thing is also, i have 2 versions - Release and Dev Channel - Double complicated.<br />
A other thing is, when bblog get through the validation process and for some reason somebody find a TOS violating thing in BBLog it get blocked and nobody can use BBLog anymore.<br />
<br />
Crap over crap in any way. I hate google every day more.<br />
Really need to switch my whole google things out of google.            </div>

                Well, that doesn&#039;t sound too good. I guess the only way (starting January 2014) without local installation is to use another browser based on Chromium?            </div>

As I said, trying it out won&#039;t hort. The extension here has a different ID than the one which would be in the play store. This means BBLog won&#039;t be disabled for everyone. Also, Adblock and Adblock Plus, the most used extensions for Chrome are loading from URLs (filter list). It does not happen everytime you visit a page, but the thing is it IS happening every 3 / 4 days. As long as you do nothing evil and the user can decide what he wants to do BBLog should be fine.<br />
If you have Skype, feel free to add me under the same name as here in the forum. We can test publishing it in the webstore then.<br />
Dev and Stable version is no problem.            </div>

                Thx kurtextrem, but i have many other reasons too why i don&#039;t want the extension on the web store.<br />
I be sure, for 50%, that google not deactivate all possibilites to add external crx files.<br />
But, let us wait until middle/end of december.<br />
<br />
PS: Just for the note, loading simple data from urls (JSON/XML) is NOT the same as loading &lt;script&gt; tags from external, untrusted urls (plugins). Anyway,lets wait until dec.            </div>

Yeah I know, but that&#039;s not interesting because the plugin itself doesn&#039;t load anything without user&#039;s instructions. Only because there is a possibility to add scripts it doesn&#039;t mean it is not allowed (see Adblock).            </div>
