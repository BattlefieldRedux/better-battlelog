                Would be nice to see top 3 players for each category in the platoon top players stats page, instead of 1. This would be really handy especially for larger platoons, but nice addition for smaller ones too. <br />
<br />
Adding new stats to the top players table would also be welcome, such as: over all score per minute (not class) / k/d ratio / number 1 positions. Right now the top players table if filled with some less relevant stats.            </div>
