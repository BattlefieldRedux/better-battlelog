                Would it be possible to incorporate an icon indicating the player&#039;s rank when displaying them in the Com Center? This has the potential to be very request intensive. It may be worth while including a few options for request intensive services. The Com Center seems finicky, it may be worth while using battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/user/aUsername/friends/.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to create a tooltip box with the rank icon (and other info?) when you hover over a friend&#039;s name/avatar in the Com Center or on any other pages where players are linked.<br />

                There some more problems with that.<br />
One ORFK already told - Another problem is that this feature require some additional requests - One for every user, which is simply a disaster.<br />
There some ways to do a workaround with less requests (bf3stats) but it can heavily increase the load of their server too.<br />
BBLog is not designed to overload any server&#039;s - So this is now rejected.            </div>
