                or at least give me the option of not showing them all together. it should be an option in the main menu, just like integrate bf3stats.com<br />
<br />
it&#039;s bad enough that most of us just lost an credit for an official assignment or 2 after the last update. i don&#039;t want my blog page showing I have assignments to complete that aren&#039;t official. <br />
<br />
don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s a cool idea.... I just want to be able to turn it off completely not just minimize it. I don&#039;t want the tab at the top that says BETTERBATTLELOG 3/8 <br />

thanks            </div>

                Our member ask for this too.<br />
Maybe you can add a button or a plugin to hide the new Assignments?            </div>

                <blockquote><div class="user">ORFK wrote:</div>whats wrong with you?<br />
are you all just want to have assigmens were you can get something? a dogtag? points? weapongs? is that the point wich you really need?<br />
<br />
not enough if something is calculating assigments by the way how you play?</blockquote><br />
<br />
What&#039;s wrong with who? <br />
<br />
The idea of the random voted on user assignments is fine.... but there should be an option for those of us that don&#039;t want them.... just like there are option to turn on and off other aspects of bblog. Your adding something to that many users DO NOT WANT. In fact I would say that most people want to see the weapon stats, the awards and maybe a custom theme but that&#039;s it. The rest is overkill.<br />
<br />
And yes assignments created by the game designers with awards are prevalent.            </div>
