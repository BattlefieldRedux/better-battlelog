            <div class="post-main">
                But first, i begin with the past.<br />
<br />
2011, with the start of battlelog, Better Battlelog has come to life. All beginned with a super small set of features.<br />
BBLog was growing and growing over the years and now it&#039;s a worldwide used goody for battlelog, for advanced and casual users as well. It&#039;s possible only with the help of the community, great translators, awesome supporters and such kind of contributors.<br />
<br />
Right now, as of March 2015, my spare time changed a bit and BBLog is now pretty much unchanged since some months. This have several reasons, one of this is my lack of spare time, another reason is that there is simply not that much to improve on battlelog as it was some years ago.<br />
<br />
Some features that have been rejected for integration into BBLog have been done by plugin and theme developers. They make that stuff for that i don&#039;t have time or for things that simply doesn&#039;t fit my &quot;style guideline&quot; for BBLog features.<br />
<br />
BBLog is used by about 23.000+ users, every single day. Cool, isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
Now talk about the future topics<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b"><div class="tag tag-u">Mozilla Firefox Support  - Maybe will be dropped</div></div><br />
This reason is simple. Mozilla will reject all extensions that are not signed by AMO (Mozilla Addon Center) - <div class="inline post-url">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/02/10/extension-signing-safer-experience/</div> In general i support that idea, it helps us all to get rid of the unwanted extensions that come with several installers. Google chrome have done the same a year ago.<br />
What i can do is to submit the addon to mozzila addon center. I&#039;ve done so a few weeks ago. Right now, nothing happened. The sign process of mozilla is horrible, slow and so much strict.<br />
BBLog is designed to work on several browser engines with the same code - That mostly not fit with mozilla addon rules because they say you should use mozilla native code whenever possible, you should not use that or this, etc...<br />
That&#039;s not the biggest problem, it&#039;s fixable, the big hammer is simply that they need over a month to check a newly uploaded addon version. That&#039;s horrible. That haven&#039;t changed since years, i tried it at the beginning of BBLog - I decided to remove the addon from their addon center because of that behaviour.<br />
Maybe it will be better in the near future but i don&#039;t have much hope for that.<br />
Firefox usage shrink since years, 25% of all BBLog users currently use firefox, some years ago it was 75%.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u"><div class="tag tag-b">Windows 10 - Spartan Browser - Maybe will be supported</div></div><br />
I follow every news about that. Microsoft decided to integrate a similar extension system as google chrome has. I like that and whenever possible BBLog will support this browser from the beginning of his live.<br />
This will possibly result in a huge grow of the userbase when W10 comes to life.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u"><div class="tag tag-b">Battlefield Hardline</div></div><br />
It will be fully supported by BBLog with mostly the same features as for Battlefield 4. Expected release a few days after BF Hardline release. However, i&#039;ll not buy that thing.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u"><div class="tag tag-b">Star Wars Battlefront</div></div><br />
I plan to support that as well because it will use battlelog as well. I&#039;m excited about a new franchise on battlelog.            </div>

                Update to Star Wars Battlefront.<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/32wdet/star_wars_battlefront_will_not_use_battlelog/cqfdknk</div><br />
<br />
All that info come from the DEVS and producers directly and i interpret this now:<br />
<br />
1. There will be no battlelog for star wars battlefront, i think that&#039;s plausible.<br />
2. They also said that there is &quot;No browser game launching&quot;, also i think that&#039;s plausible - Browser game launching is one of the most controverse features in battlelog. Battlelog itself is cool for stats and stuff like that, but not for game launching, that should be a in-game browser, imho.<br />
3. Uprise Dev said: &quot;The thing we (Uprise) are working on is built from scratch.&quot; - That means to me that they work on a new web-based thingy for community stuff for star wars, i think that&#039;s plausible also. Star Wars as a way more different than the BF or MOHW series, using the battlelog for Star wars battlefront will be like using a cube for a round hole.<br />
<br />
All in all i am pretty sure that we can expect a &quot;starlog&quot; community platform without game launching instead of a &quot;battlelog&quot; community with game launching. If yes, i will make a &quot;Better Starlog&quot; if possible and required :)            </div>
