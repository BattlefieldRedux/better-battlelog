                I&#039;m ready to force feed a baby my feces after today. I will link the picture I WANT in my BBlog Sig. <div class="inline post-url">http://g.bf3stats.com/360/XQ3kMT8Q/The%20Iowa%20Ninja.png</div><br />
I will link my struggles and in the end, rage, in a link as well. <div class="inline post-url">http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/forum/threadview/2832654348461209757/1/</div>            </div>

                What a confusing post, this is. My god, it took me a few minute to understand it. Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but you want to make a picture clickable to a custom site, not the official linked site, right?<br />
<br />
If that&#039;s so, it isn&#039;t integrated, yet. And I guess it won&#039;t be either. Maybe a plugin developer will make it? :)<br />
Note: it could be possible that we, BBLog, have disabled it. Some other members need to confirm or decline it.            </div>

Somehow people get confused! I want that picture. In my BBlog signature. You know? The free sig you get on Battlelog. I want that picture in there, but it&#039;s only becoming a link. I want it to be a picture not &quot;Http://&quot;            </div>
