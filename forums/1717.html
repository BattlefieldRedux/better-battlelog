                I had not seen this idea posted on here maybe on the official battlelog forums but there is a lot of spam there.  I&#039;d like to see a couple things for server browser history, the ability to sort time visited and number of times visited.  The third thing which maybe more of an issue for ea/dice would be to be able to delete servers in the history either have it so you can clear all or maybe just a couple of servers.  Great plugin though thanks for providing it for the community.            </div>

                hello<br />
<br />
i know that there are some problems with the server history in our profiles.<br />
i really don&#039;t know wich server will be listed and wich not or in wich order.<br />
<br />
it could be possible (by our addon) that you will get a own server history, for that battlelog should be activated all the time, and it could save a list with the servers. but you wouldn&#039;t be able to show this list to other, because that&#039;s require a online save of your history (same discussion like by avatars without gravatar)<br />

don&#039;t know what brian will say to this idea. we will see =)            </div>

                Because this data isn&#039;t stored anywhere we cannot do that kind of sorts.<br />
And also we cannot modify existing data more than battlelog already can.<br />
