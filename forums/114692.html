                I was kinda hyped but after seeing some Alpha gameplay videos it didn&#039;t impress me too much, in fact the infantry gameplay reminds me of CoD, maybe the mech gameplay will bring something new.            </div>

                My initial thought when I saw the gameplay videos was &quot;CoD with Mechs&quot;. We&#039;ll see how it turns out. Also, it&#039;s published by EA so I don&#039;t really expect anything good.            </div>

                I expect the following scenario: Massively overhyped - Many will buy it because all trailers and other official promotion stuff will look epic.

                I&#039;m looking forward to it, but I can&#039;t get it when it&#039;s released, because Microsoft still haven&#039;t decided when to launch the Xbox One in Sweden (I could import, but I&#039;d rather not).<br />

i think the same.. to much PR for bad games, like everytime when EA is publishing something &quot;new&quot;.<br />
thats typically for EA. good game, small PR, bad game, big PR, and when did EA small PR last time? actually i doens&#039;t really know anymore *laughing*<br />

True, but you can not compare GTAV and The Divison with each other. That&#039;s like comparing Call of Duty with Battlefield. Loads of people do it, but they are two different games. :-)            </div>

                what i mean is: in GTAV they told it would be really dinamyc with the robbery missions. finally you had only 2 or 3 missions where you could choose between two options, not more! i think by the division could it goes to the same direction, that you dont have so many options they&#039;re told.            </div>

                Tested the BETA right now for about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Good tutorial about all possible features. <br />
*Very fast gameplay. <br />
*Titan plays like a typical mech-machine. <br />
* In basic no weapon recoil/spread (like COD) - Require less skill, forces fast gameplay.<br />
* Many in-game messages and especially when many titans are on the battlefield it confuses me alot, just shotin randomly on all moving objects.<br />
* For the current average graphics it requires a lot PC power - Stuck on my computer with 1920x1080 on medium settings. BF4 runs fine at high on the same resolution. Maybe a Beta Issue.<br />
* Fresh new mechanics with vertical gameplay because of double jumps, wallruns and a combination of them.<br />
* Pretty much all feels very similar to COD - XP, Menu, Interface, Gameplay.<br />
<br />
For me, i don&#039;t will buy that game. Just another solid shooter but no highlight for me.            </div>
