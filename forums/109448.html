The language menu is already accessible (http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/language), but it does not work. I would say they are going to release translations with release of the full game at the 29th.            </div>

They buy/hire a company who &quot;translate&quot; interfaces. But they don&#039;t see if it&#039;s correct or not.<br />
A lot of services have a poor translations (Facebook and Fancy f.e.).<br />
<br />
My english is bad, but when i see this translations, i think i have a good english... :(            </div>
