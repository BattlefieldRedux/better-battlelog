                Hi BBL team,<br />
thx for creating such a powerfull tool.<br />
<br />
A nice little feature would be the points that are left for each class service star. I don&#039;t want to calculate 8% of 132 844 Points. Would be fitting in the tooltip above the class progress like in the medal tooltips.<br />
<br />
Also a very useful feature (actually that was why i search advances for battlelog and found your plugin) would be a possibility to change the sortings of the awards. Or at least auto-sort by awards which will be achieved next. At the moment the sorting to me looks random and i have to look for a while until i find that one which only has some points left.            </div>

                Ah ok sry, just found another request for award sorting. But maybe the autosort by progress thingy is worth a try ;)            </div>

                Hi!<br />
<br />
Sorting a horrible peace of work so i would change nothing anymore at this point.<br />
For class progress (left points) i can do something for you.<br />
Keep watchin for next update.<br />

                Ok thx for adding the feature! <br />
<br />
For the sorting: so i have to implement my own stand alone tool for it ;)            </div>
