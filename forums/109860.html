It looks like they gave BF4 a very serious tone but with much better writing than BF3. BF3 had a ok story, but it wasn&#039;t anything spectacular.            </div>

You&#039;re not a cowboy, most of the gamers did and will do the same. :)            </div>

                I loved the BC2 single player, but the BF3 single player was pretty bad in my opinion. I had to force me to play through (it helped that the internet connection was interrupted a few times), while I played at least twice through BC2.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t expect too much, but of course I will look into it.            </div>

                So, got my hands finally to the SP.<br />
I like it, better than BF3 SP in my opinion.<br />
Also the sometimes &quot;different&quot; ways to solve problems is good, it&#039;s still heavily linear but sometimes you have the choice how and when you do something.<br />
<br />
And, what surprised me very much, i can play it on Full HD Ultra with my current system, and it run smooth. Sometimes just minimal drops but in general it&#039;s running &gt; 30fps.<br />
