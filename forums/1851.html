                This plugin integrates the playing Dice employees in your comcenter. This allows you to join their servers in one click. You can also see if they have a Dice or a Dev team dogtag equipped.<br />
The list of players comes the the Official DICE Platoon and is refreshed every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
<div class="inline post-url">https://raw.github.com/azixMcAze/DiceFriends/hunt-dice/DiceFriendsPlugin.js</div><br />
<br />
Note : The dice players int the com center are drag and drop-able like any online friend, but I have no idea if you can invite them to a party or to join a server. Maybe it is better to not try :). But anyway, I will try to prevent that in a future release<br />
<br />
As I said in Pun1a&#039;s thread, it seems that I am late with this plugin, but the plugin is done and it would be a waste to not share it anyway :)<br />
<br />

Yes it, the plugin only list the payers on the DICE platoon, Stalk Dice lists more players. I will try to a more complete list of players in a future version            </div>

                The bright dogtag icon means that the player has the Dice dogtag (with the 3 on it) required to unlock the m1911 S-Tact, the darker icon means that he only has the Devteam dogtag (with the three lines of text)            </div>

                Your version is better, I must admit. I wrote my plugin in one night (drunk much cola, haha) and after that night I didn&#039;t have the time (and the desire) to improve it. So I have to thank you, I don&#039;t have to work on that plugin anymore! haha :D<br />

Hi, this plugin only adds players at the bottom of the comcenter, it will not modify or reorganise your friend list. So sorry, no groups.<br />

Yes, some are really big campers :D<br />
But with a constant assault from dogtag-hunters, I understand they prefer hiding and waiting for the kills :D<br />

Can you tell me if everything is working correctly? I will release it to <div class="inline post-url">http://userscripts.org/</div> if everything is ok<br />
<br />

The current version of DiceFriends fetches the DICE employees only from the DICE official platoon. It only works with a platoon, not a list of players.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I am working with furydivine on an alternative solution. Stay tuned!            </div>

                I&#039;m using it now. It took me a bit to get it to work. I had to click on the RAW link for it to work.<br />

I&#039;ve been working with furydivine as well to make his site look better and emailed him the suggestion about the plugin.<br />

It&#039;s listing the console players as well, which is good for those that use BBL while they play on console.            </div>

                There was an error in the first version I release, it was using a local file (for debugging purposes) on my pc, instead of hunt-dice data :D. Or are your referencing another problem ?<br />
The link I gave to furydivine was pointing directly to the file and should be usable directly in bblog<br />

I tested the integration of console players in this version, I think I will also add it in the original version.            </div>

                I just uploaded a new version with three important changes :<br />
<br />
- It no longer gets the player list from the Official DICE platoon, but from <div class="inline post-url">http://www.furydivine.net/hunt-dice/</div> thanks furydivine for your cool site!<br />
- As a result, it is no longer limited to the DICE employees that joined the platoon. It will display all the players on Hunt DICE, including the players that got the Dice Friend dogtag! Yay!<br />
- It will also display the console players. (I am still not sure if I will keep this feature as-is. maybe create two versions of the plugin, including or not the console players. Let me know what are your thoughts about it)<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">One important note :</div> This is not an update of the plugin, but a new version. If you have DiceFriends installed, you will need to remove or disable your version and add the new link :<br />
<br />
<div class="inline post-url">https://raw.github.com/azixMcAze/DiceFriends/hunt-dice/DiceFriendsPlugin.js</div><br />
<br />
Even if this new version has some improvement, I did not wanted to force it to all the current users mainly because of the use of a third party site. (and specifically the use of jsonp instead of json)<br />
<br />
anyway, enjoy this new version            </div>

I got a question: is there a possibility to add a custom players list? Cause im not hunting DICE employees, but players with exclusive dogtags like the &quot;5 times mortar medal&quot;. <br />

Or can you show me how to add a local file instead of an url?<br />

                I am sorry but this is not possible at the moment. Using a custom file instead of this url would not be of any help, because it should contain not only the list of players but also all the information the plugin needs (online presence, server, dogtags)            </div>

                Suggestion: Can you make it so when the player has Dice Friend tags instead of the Dev tags the dog tag icon is a different color?<br />
I looked at the java script code and saw what image files it&#039;s pulling the dog tag image from and noticed there was a yellow one. Maybe use that for the Dice Friend tag for those folks.<br />

Some times I want to go join them and then I see which tag they have when I mouse over and I say to myself, never mind.            </div>

                I&#039;m happy to see you fixed the plugin but the update messes with the Weapon service stars under the Unlocks area.<br />
I had to disable the plugin, then restart the browser and login again for them to show up.<br />

There is indeed a problem with the weapon service stars, but it happens even when the plugins are disabled. Just reload the page and the stars disapear            </div>

Ok yep, it&#039;s a BBL thing. I had only noticed this after your plugin got updated and thought the 2 were related. I hadn&#039;t noticed the fact that I had refreshed the page during the time I had noticed the problem.            </div>

I can confirm that. For me there are no tooltips ( ... kills remaining) under the stars as well. Any news about fixing this?            </div>

It&#039;s probably going to take a while for a plugin update, if no one else will do it.            </div>
