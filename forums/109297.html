                Installed it fine when 3.7 first came out and it workd ok on my win764/Firefox 24 setup. Just tried it again now and BB has disappeared. Have rebooted, reinstalled BB several times and confirmed that it is enabled and running as an extension in firefox but still not sign of it. Am sure I am doing something stupid.. Anyone help?            </div>

                I have read through the suggested solutions for the known issues but, unfortunately, i think they were created for an older version of Firefox - most of them don&#039;t make sense for Firefox 24&#039;s options (which is what I assume they mean when they say &quot;settings&quot;) menu...            </div>

<br />
&quot;Firefox Settings&quot; = Tools &gt; Options (or Settings, idk in english).<br />
<br />
For javascript settings, this is has been removed from lasts Fx options, but you can find in &quot;about:config&quot; (type that on url bar) .<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">Disable or replace context menus:</div><br />
Uncheck this option/preference to prevent web pages from disabling or changing the Firefox context menu.<br />
<br />
    In about:config: <div class="tag tag-i">dom.event.contextmenu.enabled</div><br />
    (default=true, set to false to block sites) <br />
<br />
Or install this extension: <div class="inline post-url">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/settingsanity/</div><br />
<br />
Need to be true to BBLogs works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is hard to maintain updated Know Issues and all settings across the browsers. I know Firefox &#039;cause i follow Firefox maillist and change codes, but i don&#039;t know nothing about Chrome.            </div>

                Please try the known issue point 3 (new firefox profile).<br />
You can also try to post your console output.<br />
Press F12, Switch to console tab and reload the battlelog page, if you see error messages (red colored) than post it here.            </div>

                OK. I was being a moron. I had not realised you had completely changed the presets menu and so was looking for the usual yellow icon with all my server presets. The new three line grey icon was too subtle for me! <br />
Apols and thanks for your time and for an invaluable tool.            </div>
