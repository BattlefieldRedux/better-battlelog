                Hey guys and thank for a really great result from obviously a shit load of work you do on this, i only have one beef, I am from the Republic of Ireland and i know there are allot of like minded gamers from here who have said they have concerns, Incidentally, I have been trying to push this add-on to all i know. They all love it so far. The beef is having the new language tab &quot;USA&quot; and &quot;Great Brittan&quot; flags combined. My suggestion is having English or Other tab that you can then pick from, Picking from countries i think will alienate those not shown, great work so far :-)            </div>

                Hm, i don&#039;t know what you actually mean.<br />
So can i solve the problem when i remove combined flags and replace it with only &quot;USA&quot;.<br />
Having more flags for one language is unnecessary.<br />

                I understand you cant have every country for a particular language, so I suppose the flag feature position itself is a bit too prominent. Once somebody chooses a language they will not need to change it, so having the tab so very visible on the main battlelog page is a bit unnecessary, I suggest keeping the &quot;BB Log Centre&quot; tab and by clicking on that , you can then choose the language. I like the quiet integration of Better Battlelog :-)            </div>

                Ok, check! You&#039;re right.<br />
For the initial release its good for everyone to see it permanently, to get notice of it.<br />
In the next update i implenent it only when you opened bblog to keep it invisible during normal page usage.<br />
