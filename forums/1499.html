                I use a translator. maybe you will understand me correctly.<br />
<br />
transport helicopters, aircraft weapons - have unlock.<br />
Different unlocks occupy different slots in the game.<br />
when viewing, such as tank T90, below we can see in the batlloge - T-90A unlock progression<br />
I suggest: in the upper left corner (on every unlockers) add a digit (1,2,3), which will be the same slots in the game.<br />
for example:<br />
ir smoke - 2 slot in the tank. You have done the same with the medals and badges.<br />
It will be very handy!<br />
You can not begin the game, understand compliance to unlock the slot.<br />
If you do not understand me, then I can try to explain again))<br />
Thank you for the work.<br />
I hope you will continue to work and grow!<br />

                Hi!<br />
You are confusing something.<br />
In medals/ribbons numbers show you how much ribbons you must earn for next medal.<br />
So it&#039;s a bit useless to add slot numbers, i think. <br />
The better way is to see the progress, how much points you are away from next unlock - And thats already included by battlelog.<br />
Rejected because i think it&#039;s i too minor improvement and only helpful for few users.<br />
