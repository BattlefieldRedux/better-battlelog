                Would be nice to have a thumbs up / thumbs down on the server listing with an overall rating. <br />
One thing worse than playing on a server with a cheater is playing on servers with terrible admins. It would be nice to know that there is potential for having a bad time on a server.            </div>

                I think that this has been mentioned a few times. <div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com/en/board/topic/98631/1/Server-Rating</div><br />
Something similar to the local comments could be done, but most likely collaborative ratings won&#039;t be done.            </div>

                BBLog will not include public ratings for a server.<br />
This is not fair in different ways - Public ratings/likes/etc. are never &quot;objective&quot;, they depend very much on the daily situation of a player.            </div>

                I think this idea is good, I hate servers where you get autobalanced every 2min(bf3)<br />
First prototype: <div class="inline post-url">http://prntscr.com/27wxu4</div><br />
<br />
I&#039;ll look into how I&#039;ll do the rating system and whether I&#039;ll add a full rating system or not. Also have to think about a way to stop players from rage voting (because of a bad KD).            </div>

No disrespect but this isn&#039;t in the feature requests. I can understand bblog not wanting to officially add this. Its no different than say the cheat o&#039; meter.<br />

Well maybe an over rating is a bad idea. but a likes/dislikes number without the server being &quot;ranked&quot; in any kind of way wouldn&#039;t hurt. there needs to be a stat that shows in general players did or did not like playing on this server for whatever reason. 50 players disliked a server maybe because they had a bad KD but 100 liked it. I&#039;d join that server. If 10 people liked a server but 30 people didn&#039;t, it doesn&#039;t matter the reason. There&#039;s tons of servers I wouldn&#039;t waste time trying to figure out what that server in particular has got it bad.<br />

                Sorry that there were no news lately... It&#039;s exams time here for me. (= Almost no free time)<br />
Here is the current progress (does not look very different from the previous screenshot, but back then it only was a mockup without any dynamic (AJAX) functions): <br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://i.imgur.com/YaqkvqY.png</div><br />
<br />
Things to do on the front end:<br />
- Add a way to rate<br />
<br />
Backend:<br />
- Database<br />
<br />
<br />
Got a few things in mind which I also want to do, but that will take time.            </div>

                One idea, when a user disconnects from a server (you can use the text in the blue bar or the color next to your avatar), show a popup with the rating buttons.            </div>

Fixed the things, thanks for your feedback! (The rate bar dis/appearing thing is because it refreshes)            </div>
