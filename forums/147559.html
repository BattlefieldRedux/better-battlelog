                Hello together,<br />
<br />
quick question. How can I delete an item from the BBLog storage? The removeItem function which is JS providing is here not working, someone has a quick tip?<br />
<br />
Also is says: &quot;Please use this not as much because users browser storage is limited&quot;. Does it mean that I should not create like 100 vars in the storage or does it mean that the stored data shouldn&#039;t be to big? Because for a plugin I would like to save some server guids. Depending on how much server the user wants to store it&#039;s possible that there are a lot of guids in it.<br />
Is there a number of data I shouldn&#039;t exceed?            </div>
        </div>

                It simply depends on the size of the saved data, see &quot;localStorage&quot; limitations of Html5.<br />
All plugins and bblog itself share one localStorage element, therefore the plugin should not save tons of data.<br />
<br />
If you mean delete storage in a plugin, always use &quot;instance.storage()&quot;, overwrite your value with &quot;null&quot;, this means &quot;deleted&quot; in our case. Explicit delete does not exist. If you call the storage getter you also get null when the key doesn&#039;t exist.            </div>
