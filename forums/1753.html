                As the subject said, in the server browser, everytime I click &quot;Refresh and Save Setting&quot; the set region area always reset to default for no reason, and I have also test it by disable BBLog and the feature is working fine. I notice the problem rising only after BBLog update to the 1.9 version.<br />
<br />
BBLog version: 1.9<br />
Google Chrome 20 BETA<br />
<br />
On side note, although my Chrome is a beta version but I never had any problem with BBLog before, plus since the vanilla version is working fine so it mean it is BBLog&#039;s fault. Thanks.            </div>

                Thanks for reporting this bug. It was most likely caused by the new Battlelog update that broke BBLog.            </div>

                I don&#039;t think that is produced by BBLog.<br />
BBLog doesn&#039;t touch server filter things in any way.<br />
I tried to reproduce - This error happens right but for me also with disabled BBLog.            </div>
