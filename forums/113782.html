                Just logged into Battlelog to respond to a forums post but I couldn&#039;t, because &quot;You are not allowed to post in the forum until 01.16.2014 12:02&quot;.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really knew why, so I looked into my previous comments and found out that my advice to install Better Battlelog to someone who asked how the signature feature works, was apparently reason enough to get temporarily banned. Lol<br />

Yeah, I guess that the moderator doesn&#039;t understood my subtle (but clearly noticeable) sarcastic worded opinion about the Premium perk &quot;forum signature&quot;. It was my mistake, I always expect people to be intelligent. Lol            </div>

Haha, that&#039;s a good advice. I usually keep away from the forum. The amount of useful threads and/or (especially) mature users is pretty low.            </div>
