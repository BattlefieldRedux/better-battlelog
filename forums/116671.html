                I searched the forum and I do apologize if I did not use the correct search words for this feature. <br />
I was requesting a server filter to must contain maps selected. Currently if you select all expansion maps, they display servers containing any of the maps selected instead of showing only servers that contain all maps selected. Also I was wondering if Better Battlelog improved on server search because I can refresh 3 times and get 3 different lists. It doesn&#039;t seem to find all the servers on first try. Thank you.            </div>

                Sry. We cannot change the search behaviour in this way in battlelog.<br />
This only can be done by DICE.            </div>
