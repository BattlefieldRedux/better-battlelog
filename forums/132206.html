                Hi, my prob. is, I am In thailand i bought ps4 here, when it come out ps store wasnt working well, card payments problems in thai store and no thai psn cards.<br />
 <br />
So I bought BF4 disc and installed it on my thai psn acc, then i wanted it to upgrade to premium, I could not do it under thai acc, so I registered Hong Kong acc and bought HK dollars psn cards, and bought premium under HK psn acc.<br />
 <br />
So now I play bf4 under HK psn acc, as its premium, on thai there is no premium.<br />
 <br />
PSN+ is under thai acc.<br />
 <br />
both bf4 games are linked to same origin acc...<br />
 <br />
would it be possible to merge/move everything from HK psn to Thai ?<br />
 <br />
that be bf soldier and premium ?<br />
 <br />
my origin ID is M474L30<br />
 <br />
Thai Bf4 mataleo-th<br />
 <br />
HK bf4 Fr3n7Y-TH<br />
 <br />
can move premium and soldier from HK psn to Thai PSN ?<br />
 <br />
Thank You, hope you understand it...            </div>
