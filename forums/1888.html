There is a lot of Diablo Fans, so i want to ask if anyone is gonna play this stuff<br />
<br />
Its only at 19.99$ on Steam (Pre-Order) with Torchlight as a gift for pre-ordering, i already pre-ordered, so, i&#039;m playing Torchlight and i really like it, specially the pet system.<br />
<br />
BTW. from wikipedia:<br />
<br />
&quot;Development of the game was led by Travis Baldree, designer of Fate, joined by Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer <div class="tag tag-b">(co-designers of Diablo and Diablo II),</div> and the team that worked with Baldree on the original incarnation of Mythos. Runic Games has announced a sequel Torchlight II, planned for release on PC in 2012.&quot;<br />
