                Hi Community!<br />
<br />
Exact 1 year before today, BBLog was released in the first working developer version.<br />
That means, BBLog B-Day is today.<br />
<br />
For that reason i started a little lottery game where you can win a DLC of your choice for Battlefield 3.<br />
This DLC is sponsored by BBLog directly (by me).<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-b">What you need to do for it?</div><br />
<br />
Not that much. <br />
1. First, you must make sure that you have a Battlelog Account and a BBLog Account (on getbblog.com).<br />
2. Than you must connect your Battlelog Account with your BBLog Account (My Account -&gt; Settings -&gt; Click on &quot;Connect with Battlelog&quot;) - You must have BBLog installed and activated that this will work.<br />
3. At last, write here in this thread why Better Battlelog is awesome :-) If you write multiple posts with one user, it doesn&#039;t increase your chance to win.<br />
<br />
At the end,  16.01.2013, i choose a random winner within all the comments here in this post.<br />
Team Member&#039;s cannot win that DLC. This thread must have a minimum of 250 Posts, under this line the price goto nobody.            </div>

                Better Battlelog is awesome because you can edit EVERYTHING in the Battlelog. Before BBL was built up the old Battlelog looked shitty and oldschool. It was not as attractive. But most i like the background changing option and the new assignments because it gives new style to your Battlelog and the assignments make you want to achieve something in Battlefield3 when you made it all the way through the game. <br />
And thats why i love BBL.<br />
btw special thanks to the producers of BBL            </div>

                It&#039;s awesome because u have bunch of settings to edit your battlelog how you want and how you think it&#039;s the best way for you to navigate trough the battlelog. I specially like theme and background switching thing nice way to have custom backgrounds. One thing that i like are the radars. BATTLELOG IS SIMPLY AWESOME!            </div>

                BBlog is awesome because of the easily accessible weapon data and server filtersets.<br />
It does a lot more, but even just these 2 things save a lot of time.            </div>

                I really like BBlog because it&#039;s the way Blog is supposed to be.With themes,more info about players,server info,weapon and players stats.One of the best things for me are those awesome themes,because after a year of playing you get kinda bored with the standard theme that Blog has and thank god you have BBlog that has such good themes.I truly love them!Another badass thing about BBlog is that it&#039;s radar option.You can&#039;t believe how many times this has helped me.(I have used the radar at some player that where cheating,at some players that where to damn good and I couldn&#039;t compete with them so I would never join a server with those players.If used the radar at some server to because of the bad admins that sit and spawn kill the other team and kicked everyone that they don&#039;t like.This could be one of the best things to.)<br />
Guys keep up the good job!!!And thanks for everything.<br />
(P.S It would be awesome if I could win an expansion.I think I would get the B2K one.These maps are one of the best.And I&#039;m kinda sick of all those vanilla maps so it would be really great!!!)            </div>

                Hi guys,<br />
i think better battlelog is awesome because everything you can imagine you can find there. Even stats like how many kills i did this day or that day or charts where the KPM or the SPM are listed can be found.I also love the inplementation into original Dice/EA Battlelog. All the other things i also like about this tiny browser app were mentioned before. Thanks for reading.            </div>

                BBlog is awesome, because I can customize the web I spend a lot of time on to my liking. For example change it to the old layout, that is centered, not this &quot;left side&quot; cr&auml;p. I love the custom plugins, backgrounds, additional stats.

                BBLOG Hands DOWN! And I will say this with honesty, the only competition I see BetterBattlelog facing are themselves. I really can&#039;t remember what my stock-Battlelog looked like, but I probably wouldn&#039;t play this game anymore without you guys. I&#039;m more social on here than Facebook haha. But really though, props to the team!            </div>

                Why BBlog is awesome? Because it makes Batterlog cooler and gives you extra options like custom assignments. That&#039;s why            </div>

                It is so awesome,because you have the possibility to work with the developers every day for a better experience<br />
for all users of this fantastic socialsystem for Battlefieldgamers ,that is better then Facebook,Really.!!!!!,you can create own plugins, own backgrounds and can report all about bugs and errors directly to the developers and not to a Mailboxsystem on the fidji isles.<br />
So Please-Stay as you are, to be independent, hard working, individually and you will be successful for a long time.!!!<br />

                Better Battlelog is awesome for many reasons, primarily because it gives more information about the weapon (information, statistics). And of course the assignments, in the drafting of which takes an involved community. And good support and attention of developers to users! ;-)            </div>

                I love the radar system, it keeps me off the servers where cheaters are and off servers that kind of douchebags with their rules. Speaking of servers the ability to create custom filters for the server browser is great but then to add to that the BBL-plugin that filters out the map list just makes it that much better.<br />
The weapons pages that shows the recoil and plots the spread and adjust the results based on the attachments is great too.<br />
Allow people to create plugins for BBL to make BBL even better than it already is is great too. It&#039;s because of that you have some of the great plugins that I use; DICE Friends, Cheat-o-meter (suggested by me, made by Pun1a), Smart Server Browser (mentioned before), and others.<br />
Rearranging the awards is also nice and I think that EA/DICE took what BBL had done and added it to Battlelog, the linking of the medals and ribbons so you can easily tell which goes with which. Nice that EA/DICE didn&#039;t credit BBL for the idea but such is life.<br />
