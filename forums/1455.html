                Could you make it so we could import ban lists from GCC and PBBans? Possibly other community lists maybe?<br />
<br />
I find the player radar really usefull to avoid cheaters but I cant just add cheaters from lists with out doing it by hand.<br />
<br />
One issue is that the addon uses the stats page ID aka Player_ID and not player name. Maybe you could add a setting to use only player names and ignore the Player_ID? This way I could run a script on a PBBans list to get all the names and import it into the addon for my own use!            </div>

                There is no feature planed to do any of your wishes.<br />
BBLog will never support GCC and PBBans Import/Export for many reasons that i not explain here detailed.<br />
But you can use and share your own BBLog Lists with others, outside of the addon.<br />
Sorry.            </div>
