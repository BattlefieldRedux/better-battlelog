                Dear Support Team,<br />
Would it be possible to add stated values to the plugin (time to kill, bullets to kill)? I&#039;m pretty sure that I&#039;m not the first to request this, but could you maybe tell me, why it has not been added yet?<br />
<br />
With friendly regards<br />

                Hi, thats requested multiple times yet.<br />
The reason why its not integrated is simple, i have not unlimited time and there are more important things currently to do :-) It needs much work to integrate all of these things.<br />
So, just wait some time and keep updated for new updates.<br />
Its a free project, that&#039;s not all what i have to do :-)<br />
