                When I first log in BBL works just fine but if I close the tab for Battlelog and later open a new tab and just go straight back to Battlelog then BBL doesn&#039;t want to load at all even if I hit refresh. I never had the problem before 3.4.0.<br />
I will say that I did a test on a fresh profile of Firefox and was unable the duplicate the problem, so yes you could say the problem is with my normal profile folder in FF. However why would it do it now and and only after the 3.4.0 update?<br />
Is there a way I can get 3.3.x again and see if the problem still exist or not?<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t as of yet tried disabling all other plugins, but BBL, in my normal profile to see if the issue still exists.<br />

                Are you logged in when you go back to battlelog?<br />
For me i&#039;m logged off when i freshly start the browser and open a other battlelog site than the home site.<br />
I always need go back to the home site to be logged in.<br />
And as you know, BBLog doesn&#039;t load when you not logged in.<br />
<br />
And no, no way to install 3.3 again.            </div>

Make sure that you don&#039;t get forwarded to the http<div class="tag tag-b">s</div> address.            </div>

I never noticed that before. That was the problem.<br />
I would type into the address bar; battlelog and naturally selected the first one listed.<br />
It also didn&#039;t help that in FF the new tab that shows the recent sites or most visited (which ever) also for some reason used the https page.<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Any chance of getting BBL to work with the https or is there a reason why it can&#039;t? Just curious.            </div>

Battlelog has no real https support - Some features don&#039;t work on the https version of battlelog. <br />
BBLog too, but we have no https support for security reasons.            </div>

BBLog for chrome doesn&#039;t get loaded anymore. Plugin is active but no changes are applied at all.<br />
Can I help somehow to debug this ?<br />

Newest dev chrome can&#039;t load bblog while previous one had no problems at all. Maybe they&#039;ve changed something for addons that don&#039;t come from &quot;market&quot;.            </div>

                The chrome version 27.x doesn&#039;t work.<br />
I don&#039;t know if this is a bug or a upcoming change in the extension structure, but it seems that v27 have even more extension restriction.<br />
Fact is that i actually can&#039;t fix BBLog for v27.<br />
Let us hope that this is just a Dev Channel  bug from chrome, otherwise probably BBLog will not be longer supported on chrome.<br />

A test with the current beta channel (v26) works fine.            </div>
