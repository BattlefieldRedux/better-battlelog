                Currently the unlock screen is sorted by percentage of unlock achieved. For example, for an unlock that requires 50 kills, and you have 40, it tells you you are 80% the way there. The problem is If you have a weapon that isn&#039;t very developed, you might have 7/10 kills with it, and it would be 70%, yet you would need less kills than the 80% example above. Sorting by kills required would allow the player to quickly amass unlocks for weapons. Or for a better example, I have an unlock coming up ACOG (4x) - 270 / 300 A-91 Kills. This is 7th on my list at 90%.I also have KOBRA (RDS) - 9 / 10 QBZ-95B Kills at 90% at 10th on my list. The difference between the two unlocks is 29 kills.<br />
Sorting by kills remaining would be the most effecient way to unlock accessories and weapons.            </div>

                Not possible without huge performance issues.<br />
We don&#039;t have access to all required unlocks that we can sort it correctly by remaining kills.<br />
Only DICE can do this.            </div>

It make no sense if you sort only 20% or less of all data, it&#039;s just wrong.            </div>

                sorry but i disagree. why should it be wrong?<br />
1 Kill is 1 Kill, it makes no difference if this 1 Kill is part of 10% from 9/10 (first unlock) or a part of the 10% which you need if you have 270/300. At the end if you want to have both you need anyway the same number of kills.<br />
<br />
if you say it makes different if you need 10 kills or 10 points (like by vehicles) than you&#039;re right. but this can be solved with splitting the list in two different onces.            </div>

                One more time, detailed.<br />
<br />
You have 100 of upcoming unlocks, on this page only 20 of them are visible.<br />
This 20 are correctly sorted over all 100 unlocks, by percent.<br />
<br />
If we sort this 20 now by kill, all other 80 that not on this page will not be integrated in this sort.<br />
<br />
So the sort by kills suggest a sort over all 100 entries by kill which we cannot do.<br />
Therefore wrong.            </div>
