probably DICE/EA will introduce this filter in a while but it would be great to have a selection of 60Hz, 120Hz and even 144Hz ! servers to choose from...<br />
<br />
i have to say that EA/DICE are really trying this time with CTE, Community Map and now with this updated ( from 10Hz initially ! ) higher performance servers options..after few bug fixes that comes with this increased communication and data rates....our BF4 will get a lot better ;-)            </div>

                This will not be possible i guess because the filter only works when some information is available for the tickrate.<br />
Currently i see no information, neither hidden nor visible in battlelog.<br />
Nevermind, changed server filters is also not possible for us because we cannot change the search query on the server. We can just change the frontend view and that&#039;s not helpful here.            </div>

                It&#039;s confirmed by DICE, that this filter will be added when fall patch is published.            </div>
