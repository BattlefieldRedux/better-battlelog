                Hi!<br />
<br />
So, now after some rounds of commander mode i am a bit confused.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s about the cruise missile.<br />
After random time i cannot fire a cruise missile anymore and i don&#039;t know why.<br />
Played in Obliteraton Mode - At first we leaded the game, after some the the enemy team had a better play and they won finally. First i thought it is because we leading but also when we turned into the looser team there was no chance for me to fire a cruise missile.<br />
<br />
Also in one game i had the cruise missile the whole game (1h game).            </div>

I don&#039;t know too much about the commander mode, because imo Battlefield 4 is so bad (server crashes, client crashes, hit detection, hit boxes, endless bugs, etc, etc) and unplayable right now, that I stopped playing and wait for a patch to get hopefully a working game.<br />

It could be either that your team lost the flag which gives you the missile and never captured it back or it could be a bug (I wouldn&#039;t be surprised.).            </div>

                Yeah, I think that it is a bug. In one game I lost the cruise missile as soon as the first of our objectives got destroyed. So I imagine that they were planning on taking away those advanced commander assets one at a time as your objectives got destroyed, but it bugged out and let you keep your cruise missile. The same thing happened to me. I had unlimited cruise missiles but the enemy commander did not. :P            </div>
