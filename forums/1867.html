                Moved this to translations.<br />
We currently add no new languages to bblog.<br />
The administration of the current set of languages is already much work.            </div>

                Sorry but you in brazil are speaking portugese.<br />
and we already have a portugese translation.<br />
<br />
otherwise we can&#039;t begin to translate Battlelog and BBLog to ALL regional language variation of a specific language. you can portugese, so that have to be enough. an american one isn&#039;t coming too and wanted to have translated everything from british english to american english.            </div>

                Honestly, I really don&#039;t care if you have a localized version of BBlog as a customer but as a developer I don&#039;t understand what is the problem of having multiple versions, as it&#039;s supported by every modern language. There are some free software which allow people all over the world to take part in colaborative process of translation. <br />
<br />
Anyway, you are not obliged to do anything you don&#039;t want: yout software, your rules. You don&#039;t have to check how many users you have in portugal or in Brazil or in any other country. It probably doesn&#039;t make much difference for you. That I understand! <br />
<br />
BUT as someone who knows both languages let me tell you that sometimes I understand english more easily than portuguese spoken in portugal. Despite that, you can still ignore it! that&acute;s your right! I understand that.<br />

                We already have a portugese translation. In fact, it&#039;s a Brazilian Portuguese, but i try to the Max not using regional words and follow the <div class="inline post-url">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acordo_Ortogr%C3%A1fico_de_1990</div> (or <div class="inline post-url">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement_of_1990</div>).<br />
<br />
Some words i preferred to leave in PT-BR, like Sobre/Acerca, Arquivo/Ficheiro and others, &#039;cause in my first contact with Roland/brain was to translate/localize BBLog to Brazilian Portuguese. And i&#039;m Brazilian. :P<br />
<br />
So, all BBLog plugin already translated. I&#039;ll translate the old news when i have time.<br />
<br />
You can change your language in BBLog site and plugin clicking in Brazilian/Portuguese flag (http://getbblog.com/img/layout/pt.png), at top (site) or top-right side (plugin).<br />
Any criticism, suggestion or anything else about this localization, you can post here or send me a PM.<br />
