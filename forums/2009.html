                Is it possible to break up the dogtags when just viewing them to be something like this:<br />
Section 1 Being all Left tags and Section 2 being all Right tags.<br />
<br />
Section 1; Part 1: Ranks<br />
Section 1; Part 2: Generic Efficiency Tags (i.e. PDW tags, Armored Warfare tags, etc.)<br />
Section 1; Part 3: Weapon/Vehicle Specific Efficiency Tags<br />
Section 1; Part 4: Premium/Dice/Other Exclusives<br />
<br />
Section 2: Pretty much the same way.<br />
<br />
Essentially, it would stay in the same order it&#039;s in now but with visual page/section breaks.<br />
<br />
Only reason I suggest this is more for an overall aesthetic view and easier for someone like me to target what I have left to work on and to hunt down off of others.<br />
<br />
Plus, if it is possible, a way to +/- the view like the Assignments are currently done now. There are some tag sections that I have no interest in looking at anymore myself =D. I&#039;m an achievement whore, what can I say?            </div>

No Problem, I can understand. I do realize that it would most likely be a huge undertaking.            </div>

You can try installing Battlelog plus together with Better Battlelog.<br />
They have some sort of Dogtag sorting.            </div>

Currently there is 3 sorting options for seeing dogtags (All/Taken/Unlocked), which are default by Battlelog. BBLog just adds the totals of each beside them for that. Would be cool to even have a 4th option for Locked Only (to see what is left to get at a glance).<br />
<br />
When selecting what dogtags to wear, Battlelog does categorize them (Weapons/Ranks/Ribbons and Medals/Stars/Misc), but some tags are in the wrong categories.  <br />
<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of showing up like the Assignment page in a way. Sort of like, Show/Hide all Left Weapons dogtags, Show/Hide all Right Right Mastery Weapons dogtags, etc when viewing all dogatgs.<br />
<br />
But again, I know that it would be a major undertaking and if I had the know how on how to do such a thing, I would, but I have no clue to web design/coding. I&#039;m only good at organizing it myself on an Excel SS... lol            </div>

So how are you installing the an extension within another? Isnt it going to cause problem? Because I do really like the look of the dog tag section of the Battlelog Plus, however that&#039;s the only thing I like with the extension which I&#039;m afraid that when I install it on top of BBLog, it will cause problems like compatibility or worse mess up my stat.            </div>

                Many people use B+ and BBLog at the same time. No compatibility issues known.            </div>
