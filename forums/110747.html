                1. Operation Metro Conquest<br />
Solution: Operation Locker (later Opteration Metro v2) Conquest Large<br />
<br />
2. Damavand Peak Rush<br />
Solution: ??? :(<br />
<br />
3. Noshar Canals TDM<br />
Solution: ??? :(<br />
<br />

I&#039;m really sad to see my other two favorite maps are gone. Has anyone an idea what could replace them?<br />
(Noshar, just for leveling weapons and stuff... basically a compressed clusterfuck in the middle where you kill-die in a circle.<br />
Damavand for the variety of vehicles. One time only the defenders got a little bird, then both and finally tanks show up.)<br />
<br />
I could not find anything near to those descriptions yet (Haven&#039;t played that much)            </div>

                These maps just seem too different. I really am not sure if I can compare the maps of the two. <br />
None of the maps have the multi-level, on-a-mountain feel of Damavand Peak. I&#039;m gonna take a guess that Paracel Storm could feel like Noshar TDM.            </div>

                Why would you need a Noshar TDM replacement? It&#039;s the 2nd worst map ever, of all time (the 1st being Op. Metro).<br />
<br />
Damavand&#039;s peak replacement for rush... i would say Rogue Transmission, it feels the same to me.            </div>

<br />
the most horrible maps, thats right. and TDM.. thats only for statpadder and else.<br />
people who want to play in team and tactical are playing conquest, capture the flag or rush.<br />
<br />
and the best Battlefield Map is still Karkand. Sorry, but nothing can be better ^^            </div>

Thanks, I&#039;ll try that.<br />

Yeah as ORFK said I only liked Noshar for leveling my guns (and classes). It basically was a Metro without flags.            </div>
