                Hi!<br />
<br />
First at all really <div class="tag tag-b">thanks</div> for your hard work for free..... the result is <div class="tag tag-b">impressively good</div>!<br />
<br />
Yesterday I was thinking about a simple idea: with Radar I can avoid cheaters and idiots.... but very often you find good people, and good teams to play against or with.<br />
<br />
It is not easy to find people with team style, and you don&#039;t necessarily wants everybody as a friend. In this case, an elegant solution can be to flag people as &quot;good one&quot;, and than with the same Radar feature, we can see, server by server not only if bad people is there, but if good people too.<br />
<br />
This can be useful too when you wants to follow people before requesting friendship.<br />
<br />
In practice, in top of the existing friends and platoons, we can have another &quot;level&quot;: less than friends, more than unknown people, to play with.<br />
<br />
Think about it.... If you duplicate the Radar code, in such a way that we can mark people with a green sign, or a red sign, we can distinguish between good and bad.            </div>

                It&#039;s gonna be too much when we add a new radar. Some people already had problems with the existing ones. You can do this with the existing radars too when you re-arrange your own friends and ban-lists. To cut the friends into more specific group is hard work and only a few people get advantage of this - And i do not implement features that makes no advantage for most users (If it&#039;s too much work).<br />
So, rejected.            </div>

                I understand your point, but I dont want another radar: i&#039;d like the possibility to mark players as good or as bad into the existing system, and than to show him with a different colour.<br />
<br />
Basically the idea is to associate to each player selected with the radar system a flag (good or bad) than can be translated into a different symbol when you select servers.<br />
<br />
I dont know if I explained clearly, anyway if you feel it is not useful for most people, no problem.            </div>

                I see the good in this idea, I&#039;d like to use it myself.<br />
It&#039;s up to brain though.            </div>
