                By going to MOHW and then back to BF3 in Battlelog BBLog forgets its settings.<br />
<br />
I can understand that as of right now MOHW is not supported however this is a bug that does not require the game. (as stated in the stickied post)<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
This only happens Sometimes!<br />
This also seems reversible (Sometimes)<br />
When it isn&#039;t reversible you should see MOHW Theme fix itself 100%            </div>

                The reason is that BBLog on MOH:W is in a totally uncontrolled state, if a bug occurs during a storage process than this could happen.<br />
Next update come tomorrow which totally disable bblog on moh:w.            </div>
