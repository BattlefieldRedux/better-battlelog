                I don&#039;t know if many people knows that there are some tools out on the internet that helps you configure Battlefield 3. I for one didn&#039;t know about the tools until today when I by accident happen to stumble upon the Realmware platoon.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this tool is simply great :)<br />
It let&#039;s you configure all the Battlefield 3 settings out of game and even includes some hidden features that are hidden within the source code of Battlefield 3, it does all that and some more but still manages to squeeze in some game fixes as well (example: MAV key bindings).<br />
<br />
This tool could be good for film makers, it includes the option to always have the HUD on/off and some Field of View (FOV) settings.<br />
<br />
The tool I&#039;m talking about is made by Realmware, you can grab it here: <div class="inline post-url">http://bf3.realmware.co.uk/settings-editor/</div><br />
<br />
NOTE 1: You may want to turn off the cloud feature in Origin, unless you want to be botherd with it every time after you&#039;ve made any changes with the tool.<br />
NOTE 2: This won&#039;t get you banned by PunkBuster, look at the FAQ page on their website for more information.            </div>

If you ask me, this tool alone doesn&#039;t do much to make the game more awesome, it&#039;s as I said in your thread. Use this with FXAA injector and Game Booster to make the game more awesome :)<br />
<br />
The only things I use in this tool is triple buffering, MAV key bindings, fullscreen resolution and the hidden options. The main point for me though is to be able to change graphics settings without having to start the game.            </div>

                Before the patch you could also bound a key to the Heavy Brake (now it doesn&#039;t work anymore). There are also some &quot;advanced&quot; tweaks related to the console commands.<br />
<br />
Anyways one thing I really was looking for is the ability to edit the kit loadouts and appearances: <div class="inline post-url">http://bf3.realmware.co.uk/settings-editor/comparison</div><br />
<br />
But it seems they have stopped working on it (one of the creators has been offline for months).            </div>

<br />
To help push the max out of BF3 on my slightly aging  system. I went into my Program Files(x86)/Origin Games/Battlefield 3/ folder and made a text file and name it user.cfg<br />
<br />
In that text file I have:<br />
GameTime.MaxVariableFps 200.000000<br />
<code>PostProcess.DynamicAOEnable 0<br />
Render.DrawFps 1<br />
Render.DrawScreenInfo 0<br />
Render.PerfOverlayEnable 1<br />
Render.PerfOverlayVisible 0<br />
RenderDevice.Dx11Enable 1<br />
RenderDevice.ForceRenderAheadLimit 0<br />
RenderDevice.TripleBufferingEnable 0<br />
Screenshot.Format png<br />
UI.DrawEnable 1<br />
WorldRender.DxDeferredCsPathEnable 0<br />
WorldRender.MotionBlurEnable 0<br />
WorldRender.SpotLightShadowmapResolution 256<br />
WorldRender.TransparencyShadowmapsEnable 0</code><br />
<br />
That will bump your FPS up with minimal quality loss.  If it starts to stutter on you, its most likely RenderDevice.ForceRenderAheadLimit 0 Change 0 to 1,2, or 3 what ever one fixes it. <br />
<br />
(P.S. Any command you can put into the command console (~) you can put into the user.cfg and it will make it so you don&#039;t have to type it in every time.            </div>

i was looking around for the shadowmap option, and i found that if i put the values under than 256 i would get some FPS, im correct?<br />

Shadow map is at 1024 or somewhere in that range by default. So, 256 is cutting it down a lot but i suppose going lower would improve frame rates but at what cost to quality I&#039;m not sure.            </div>

Are your using  any auto graphic settings? Low, Medium, High, Ultra? If so, try changing them and using custom settings. I believe when set to auto settings it over rides the user.cfg.            </div>

                Hmmm. I&#039;m really not sure what could be going on with that.  If you want you can pull my .cfg file from my backup on dropbox and replace yours with it and see if that helps? I&#039;ll look further into for you if this doesn&#039;t work. <br />

                Thanks for the help, but I couldn&#039;t get it to work.<br />

Anyways I&#039;ve created a script which should apply the tweaks directly while in-game.<br />

I may share it if it&#039;ll be ever complete.<br />

                I&#039;ve used the BF3 editor a long time now. Miss the jet brakes, could turn on a dime.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s worth it to me for allowing the Q (spotting) button to be reassigned. I have it<br />
set to - on my keyboard keypad (top right) and on my joystick&#039;s trigger key<br />
While I use a mouse to fire, the joystick is secondary.<br />
<br />
By turning a jet with the Q (trigger) button pressed, it will light up the snipers hiding<br />
in the hills :) (normal mode).<br />
<br />
Before BF3 editor, I was using AutoHotkey to reassign my Q key. It&#039;s allowed to be used<br />
with BF3 and that&#039;s just wrong. If I wanted I could set up a AHK no recoil script using the<br />
stats from <div class="inline post-url">http://symthic.com/?s=bf3</div><br />
<br />
BF3 (Dice) also doesn&#039;t support the BF3 editor, they will never support third party programs.            </div>
