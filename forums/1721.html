                Every player with at least five actively playing friends can confirm that a battle-feed full of attachment unlocks from every game someone has played can be annoying. I have to say, Medals and Weapons are cool and often commented, but do we really need a notification for every single little new sight for <div class="tag tag-b">every</div> gun? It makes rather important messages and comment dialogues disappear fairly quickly.<br />
So if this is technically possible, you could implement the option to hide those Feed entries <br />
--&gt; possible exception if they are commented (or <div class="tag tag-i">hoaah&#039;</div>d).<br />
Thoughts?            </div>

                Seeing as I&#039;m not the developer I&#039;m not sure. I however think that it wont work unless the Battlelog staff makes some changes to support this kind of feature.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really explain :/ But as I said, I don&#039;t think it would work.            </div>

                Maybe possible but results in lot of work and probably more server requests to battlelog servers.<br />
Also currently i don&#039;t have time for it and BBLog also not want to do more requests as needed to battlelog servers.            </div>
