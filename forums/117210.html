                Hello fellow team members and users of BBLog.<br />
<br />
Today is a day I didn&#039;t think would ever come when I first joined the BBLog Team.<br />
This is the day I step down from my position as Global Moderator and Theme Developer, <br />
and instead join the ranks of the other former helpers in Helping Hand.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t been active on BBLog or Battlelog for months, I don&#039;t play BF3 any more and I&#039;ve yet to get BF4.<br />
I feel like I have nothing more to bring to the BBLog community, without making it feel like a chore, <br />
which is something I&#039;d rather not do.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been a part of BBLog almost from the start, and it&#039;s been fun being part of this project with everyone else involved.<br />
During my time with BBLog I&#039;ve had a lot of fun times, and learnt some useful skills and lessons for life.<br />
I first joined to translate BBLog to Swedish and then went on to moderate and make themes. I like <br />
to think that I&#039;ve helped shape BBLog into what it is today, even if just a tiny bit.<br />
<br />
I want to thank everyone involved with BBLog, users and members alike (former and current), <br />
for making me feel welcome and for giving me the opportunity to be proud of my time within BBLog.<br />
<br />
I wish Roland and everyone else involved continued success, within and outside of BBLog.<br />
<br />

                As already talked per PM.<br />
<br />
Bad to hear, but i fully understand, time goes by.<br />
So, have fun in whatever you doing in the future.<br />
