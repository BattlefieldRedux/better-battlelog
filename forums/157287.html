                Battlelog is not tracking my recently played games and is slowly removing games i played a week ago, I am still leveling up but no record of any of the games i have played are available from the past 7 days. The live scoreboard tracking is not working as well.<br />
<br />
I have re-installed battlefiled 4 as well as re-installed Chrome, Firefox and IE and battllelog.<br />
<br />
How do i fix these issues?            </div>
