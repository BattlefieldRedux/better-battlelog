                BBlog v. 2.2.1 with Firefox.<br />
For some reason, since I downloaded BBlog, when someone applies to the platoon, I cannot accept their application. Now I must add them as a friend and then invite them. I don&#039;t know if this is a problem on BBlog end so i may post this is battlelog as well. Before Mods get bothered in this is anyone else having this problem as well?            </div>
