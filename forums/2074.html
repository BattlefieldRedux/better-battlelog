                Since BBlog has been integrated into Google Chrome auto-updater, every time I update I lose all my custom plugins, themes, server radar, personal filtersets, pretty much it goes default in all aspects. Is there something I can do/doing wrong?<br />

Latest BBlog version, Chrome, win7.            </div>

                Auto Update is in BBLog since the beginning.<br />
You should not lose your settings. If you delete the addon and install it again, than your settings lost. If this bug still exist, you can use the &quot;Cloud&quot;. That saves your settings to BBLog server and you can restore it every time again. Just a workaround.<br />
I work on a completely restructured BBLog, maybe than your problem is solved.            </div>
