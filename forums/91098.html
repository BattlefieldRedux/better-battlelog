                I wanted to suggest three little improvements for the Loadout section.<br />
<br />
1) Add quick links similar to the ones which are in the assignments page.<br />
<br />
2) Allow to hide the loadouts you don&#039;t want to edit anymore (similar to the assignments page).<br />
<br />
3) Make the buttons more &quot;clear&quot;. Especially when I try to change attachments it&#039;s very annoying to click on the wrong one because you clicked one pixel too far. I don&#039;t know how you can do it, I think having more space between the buttons would be good enough.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a screen about it: <div class="inline post-url">http://i.imgur.com/cIax49q.png</div><br />
<div class="inline font-size-50">Yeah I know, I&#039;m not good with this sort of stuff</div>            </div>

                maybe a save button for a loadout what you want to save and take it fast when you want to change<br />
maybe 3 saveslots for loadouts per class and when you klick on save one 1 it pops out            </div>

                Sounds good but it will take a couple of hours do integrate that.<br />
So, maybe i integrate it in one of the upcoming releases.<br />
<br />
I know that DICE currently do improvements on this page, i wait a bit before i start.            </div>

                Would be nice to have a RANDOMIZE buttom to the Primary Weapon and Side Arm Loudout.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been randomizing a lot my weapon acessories since I unlocked them all. I like a little challenge!            </div>

                ANYTHING to help with the loadout page would be awesome-o! I frequently change my scopes on my weapons, and often go on a loadout spree trying out things, and truth be told - simply to change a scope in your weapon takes ages ingame. Anything that would help with using this page FAST while waiting to respawn (with dual monitors in my case) is a god send. <br />
<br />
My first 2cents would be - duplicate the apply button to the bottom of each class&#039; loadout box - preferably 100% width so it&#039;s fast wether you&#039;re changing your torch away or your scope.            </div>
