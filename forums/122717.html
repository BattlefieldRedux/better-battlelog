                Hi,<br />
<br />
why i suggest this?<br />
<br />
After 2 years in the social networks i came to the conclusion that they are useless for us.<br />
<br />
We don&#039;t get more attention because we are there, we don&#039;t get more ideas because we are there.<br />
We only have more work because we are there.<br />
<br />
So anybody have anything against it or does it just not matter?<br />
<br />
I talk about Twitter, Facebook, G+, own Subreddit.<br />
<br />
My idea is to focus all feedback in one place, here on getbblog.<br />
<br />
PS: I&#039;m obiously no friend of all social sites.<br />
<br />
<br />

* Some are for keeping just twitter - For feedback - This contactform was currently used very rare - About 10 serious questions or conversations - Pretty much useless<br />
* Some are for keeping some sites for promotion - As listed previously we have a total direct access from social sites of max. 2% from all site visitors - Pretty much useless<br />
* Some are for removing all because they don&#039;t care about social networks            </div>

                I totally agree with you, but when you do that, maybe you should enhance the forum on getbblog even more for other stuff. Make getbblog an even better community. :-)            </div>

                Hi,<br />
<br />
I agree... imho Facebook is dead for brands pages, in addition i think your audience don&#039;t use facebook<br />
G+ could be interesting in terms of SEO...what you don&#039;t need.<br />
Subreddit is unknown in France.<br />
If you had to keep only one, it will be twitter, interesting for a direct contact with your target (if you already are a twitter user)            </div>

                I kind of agree with Amkhatar that we should keep one social network (probably Twitter, maybe FB) because people often do not want to sign up on other pages. I agree with the main point of the post.            </div>

                Well, to the point of registering. <br />
<br />
I see it in a different way - People that really want to say something will register - Its easy with one click register via Twitter, FB, Battlelog - People that just want to flame, doesn&#039;t register for just that.<br />
<br />
This is how it currently work here on getbblog - We are mostly free of spam or flamers. We get only relevant feedback and suggestions.<br />
<br />
We don&#039;t get a really helpfull feedback on any of the social sites, including twitter.<br />
Since our twitter account exist, i can count the helpfull ideas or bug reports on one hand.<br />
Same on facebook.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s just my point of view, if most here say &quot;hey, just keep twitter&quot; than ok, we keep it.<br />
<br />
Just want to make clear to positives and negatives of the social stuff.            </div>

                Just a thought, but maybe the social networks arent just for feedback.<br />
I know still quite some battlefield players who never heared of bblog at all or maybe heared of it but dont know what it does.<br />
<br />
Getting more users, means more feedback. Maybe the social networks are good to show what the product is?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
So i was curious and asked a random friend:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>You 11:01<br />
just a question, do you know better battlelog?<br />
Friend 11:10<br />
better battlelog ?<br />
You 11:10<br />
yes<br />
Friend 11:10<br />
don&#039;t understand<br />
in wich way better battlelog<br />
You 11:11<br />
its and addon for battlelog www.getbblog.com<br />
Friend 11:11<br />
?<br />
oh. I use bf4stats.com<br />
You 11:12<br />
bf4stats is intergrated in bblog<br />
Friend 11:13<br />
yes, but some better stat to gain som fast track points, like do this and you get a service star<br />

<br />
Sure, social networks are not just for feedback - Many use it for product advertisment - Big companies, etc... <br />
But to show what the product really is should at first happen on the product homepage itself, or not?<br />
<br />
The best place for us to show that we exist is on the battlelog forums, were we already have sticky threads in english and german.<br />
<br />
Also my goal is not really to getting more attention to BBLog - We already have a solid userbase - My goal is to reduce the work for all team members because we all do it in our free time.            </div>

No reason to do it. But Social sites are just to promote this tool.<br />
Twitter,Facebook and G+ ( better than others because Google rules the www)... twitter and facebook is like Orkut.<br />

<br />
To be honest, it doesn&#039;t require that much work.<br />
But it&#039;s splits up the &quot;contact&quot; points to BBLog. <br />
Also it forces me to have an account on every of this sites :)<br />
<br />
The promotion power of our social site presentations is very limited.<br />
<br />
Just some facts<br />
0,9% of all visitors coming from facebook - And i guess that are all that already know BBLog :)<br />
0,2% from twitter<br />
nearly nobody from G+ or our subreddit.<br />
<br />
<div class="tag tag-u">Why remove BBLog from this sites?</div><br />
To have just one contact point, the official site. <br />
To reduce the obviously useless work on social sites.            </div>

<br />
In my opinion, social sites doesn&#039;t help you in this point when you have your official profiles there.<br />
Social sites will help when a product becomes hyped, or more &quot;viral&quot; when we say it in the social slang.<br />
And make a product hyped doesn&#039;t work when you plan it, it must happen.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want hype BBLog, i&#039;m happy with it, as it is :)            </div>

                I don&#039;t mind to stop posting/interacting with social networks, but i don&#039;t think we need to remove from them.<br />
Just put in inactive/private (have this option there?) and point in about/description that we just see our foruns.<br />
<br />
I think that people Like pages/Follow Users but don&#039;t interact too much, but when they want to know anything about it, they search in social networks first.            </div>
