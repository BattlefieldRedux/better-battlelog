                Hi, I installed BF3 limited edition and also the file. Crx (extension for Chrome Battlelog), but not part of it in the cal quick game, it in campaign and multiplayer. I also installed later, the file &quot;Battlelog-web-plugins-1.138.0-retail-prod&quot;, but nothing done, the game will not start. Thanks in advance to those who can give me some tips.<br />

                We have nothing to do with Battlelog problems. you have to go to EA/DICE for this.            </div>

Thanks for the reply, but on your site: &quot;http://getbblog.com/en/features&quot; there is a download of &quot;Better Battlelog Browser Addon&quot; Version 2.6.0 I have downloaded and installed Chrome, exactly as you say to do, dragging the file &quot;bblog.crx&quot; in the &quot;Tools -&gt; Extensions&quot;. the addon is installed perfectly, but BF3 will not start.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to those who can give me explanations about this.            </div>

I had got it, I was just wondering if this thing had happened even to someone of this forum and had a solution (which has already contacted DICE). Thanks anyway.            </div>

                If you&#039;re trying to connect and you get only &quot;connecting&quot; window and nothing else, you should try opening Origin and pres play on the Battlefield, which will redirect you to the Battlelog and it now connect you to a server. <br />

This is how I do it and it works for me.            </div>
