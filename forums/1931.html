                hey i am from germany and if i watch my profile i see wrong things! my k/d is <br />
x.xx<br />
and my score is <br />
xx,xxx,xxx<br />
!!! i mean the symbol between the &quot;x&quot; which I use here for the numbers.<br />
<br />
The problem is: in germany we use decimal point: &quot;,&quot; for numbers like &quot;i am exactly 1,8000189 meters tall&quot;,<br />
and points: &quot;.&quot;  for &quot;my new house costs 1.000.000 &euro;&quot;.<br />
<br />
hope you can understand me and i know, you guys can fix this :)            </div>

                And in Switzerland we use . for 1.8451 and &#039; for my house costs 1&#039;000&#039;000 Fr.<br />
And in Austria they have again a few other rules.<br />
<br />
so however, this is something with DICE have decided, thats so small think thats nobody is intressted in this detail. i think here is nothing needed to be fixed.<br />
