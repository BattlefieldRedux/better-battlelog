                I think it would be awesome for a community server/player blotter. For example, I check a server before joining and it has a &quot;Community warning&quot; flag by it. Thats saying something sketchy is going on in that server. Same thing with players. And to avoid spammers, that player/server and only be blotted if numerous people vote/report.<br />
Similar to Norton Firewalls community.            </div>

                This is mostly the same as global ban and cheater list, which requested a lot here.<br />
So, bblog doesn&#039;t add any feature like this.<br />
Vote/Report requires also a good server structure to make this support stable, this costs money and much time to administrate -&gt; Just another reason why its a good idea but not simple to handle by free projects without sponsors.<br />
Maybe Battlelog integrate such feature in the future.<br />
