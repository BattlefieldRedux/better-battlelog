                The current player radar only checks if a player is on your chosen server.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the players which are on my radar in the <div class="tag tag-b">Com-Center</div>,<br />
just like they were in my actual friendlist. <br />
<br />
You can easily bypass the new privacy settings by checking the friendlist from a friend of the actual player.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance!            </div>

                Em, i don&#039;t see a improvement here.<br />
<br />
The simple question is, why you should have players on your warning radar when they are in your friendlist at the same time? Do you have friends that don&#039;t really are friends? Some quirks in my head.            </div>

                no, he wants to have playes in the com center, to see on which server they are playing. these player doesn&#039;t have to be in his friendlist. he simply wants to stalk people with the radar function. thats the only reason for me, why he wants that these radar-player should be showed up in the com-center.            </div>

                Ok, i misunderstood the first post.<br />
It sounds like hunting.<br />
<br />
Also this is exactly the Extended Friendlist Plugin<br />
<div class="inline post-url">http://getbblog.com/en/board/topic/98930/1/Extended-Friendlist</div><br />
<br />
BBLog doesn&#039;t support both things, other &quot;friends&quot; in com center and stalking.            </div>

                Thx for the support! Extended friendlist is exactly what I looked for.<br />
<br />
Many of my friends already have 100 friends in their friendlist so that plugin is the only way to quickly join my friends.            </div>
