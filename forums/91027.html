Impossible and btw. kills per time have nothing todo with skill. It just show what kind of player you are but not your skill.            </div>

                sorry i meant kills per hour in attack helicopter kills tab and maybe others(i am just interested in this one). u just simply take &quot;kills&quot; and divide it by &quot;time played&quot;            </div>

                But why would you want to know it? I mean for example, in the first match you can be in a hell of a team, make lots of kills in that match. So you are a &#039;good&#039; player, with a high &#039;kills per hour&#039; ratio. The second match you are in the other team, which is rubbish as fnck. And you have only a few kills in that match. So you are a &#039;bad&#039; player, with a low &#039;kills per hour&#039; ratio.<br />
<br />
And an overall &#039;kills per hour&#039; ratio is meaningless as what. You can&#039;t compare your kills from a Rush-match with kills from a Conquest-match. Same as the time.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this is one of the most useless features.<br />
<br />
If you split all game-modes and then calculate all things you want, it would be more reasonable <div class="inline font-size-50">(still usesless though)</div>. But hey, who am I. :D            </div>

and than? every player will have different results. than you have to re-ordering this results if you want to sort the column after this data. this means that the script have to calculate everything again and trought all players because its possible that one player which is in one column on place 500 would be by the Kill/Hour column on the first place. and now, now you have BIG TRAFFIC.            </div>

lol dapil is right i can do it with calculator so why u cant program it? even i could but i thought it would be great if it was in bblog<br />
u cant even sort it by any other collumn so why i would want to sort it by this one?<br />
<br />
if it doesnt show your skill then what does? &quot;Time played&quot;? nope<br />

if you&#039;re calculating Kills/Time played, this is not the Skill.<br />
Skill is a hidden calculation by how many lower or higher ranked player had killed you or had you killed.<br />
<br />
Its simply not needed. you have already a calculation about Kill/Minute, that should be enough.            </div>
