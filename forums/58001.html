                I have a request.  Is it possible to make it so that there is either an option to hide completed assignments or to bring unfinished assignments to the top of the list?            </div>

                in general oder only for BBLog Assigments?<br />
it would be cool to have a filter option in the top of the assigments page:<br />
<br />
completed Assigments: Hidden / Visible            </div>
        </div>

                Well, i don&#039;t think that this is a good idea.<br />
Because some assignments depends on others and if you hide out completed assignment that have &quot;child&quot; assignments than you will be out of context and the view looks broken.<br />

                I would still like this. If an assignment has a assignment that needs to be completed in order to move on then it would just still be in the list, then disappear when completed. The second assignment would simply have a check mark under that part of the requirements.<br />
<br />
I assume this thread was originally about BF3, which had some weird assignment lines, but I would really love this for BF4<br />
<br />
Or if anyone knows of a plugin which does this, a link would be greatly appreciated (I&#039;m gonna put a request in the plugin forum momentarily though)            </div>
