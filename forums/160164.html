                Hi fans!<br />
<br />
Today i&#039;ve shut down the emblem gallery. <br />
Unfortunetely people not stop posting racism, terrorism and other idiotic/violating flags and emblems.<br />
I&#039;m tired of sorting out the emblem gallery every day.<br />
<br />
As we are now on a point where BBLog usage fall down constantly, there is no point of put in that much effort for this feature.<br />
<br />
Sorry for all valuable users that posted really cool emblems and artworks, you&#039;ve made that BBLog feature as cool as it was.<br />
<br />
So, that&#039;s it for now.<br />

                Hey man, I used the emblem editor with BBLog a lot and I&#039;ve really liked it. I haven&#039;t shown much interest with the built in emblem search so I would quite like if you kept the emblem editor part in. Using the extra features that BBLog gave me to create emblems was amazing, I enjoyed it so much and I&#039;m sure many other emblem creators can say the same.            </div>

                Everything is still in. Only the &quot;bblog emblem gallery&quot; is offline.            </div>
